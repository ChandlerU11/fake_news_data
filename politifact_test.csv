few basics of the tax code that buffetts op-ed takes for granted.', 'this review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.income taxes.', 'federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money.', 'lets take a married couple filing jointly as an example.', 'in 2011, after deductions and exemptions:• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;•

federal government.', 'these taxes pay for social security and medicare; its listed as fica on your pay stub.', 'typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for social security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for medicare hospital coverage.', 'the employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for social security and 2.9 percent for medicare.', 'last year, though, president barack obama and congress knocked 2 percentage points off social security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure.', 'so this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent.', 'oh, and if youre self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income.', 'payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates dont get higher the more you earn.', 'in the case of the social security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.head hurt yet?', 'ours, too.taxes on investments.', 'okay, now were getting closer to buffetts main point here, and thats taxes on investments.', 'the tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income.', 'if you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as carried interest and taxed as a capital gain.', '(the wall street journal breaks down how carried interest works.)', 'in fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains.', 'defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship.', 'they also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends.', 'we wont settle the argument here, but theres no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.getting back to buffetts op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other.', 'the fact were checking here is that the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes, while middle class taxpayers fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.hes right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job.', 'very little of this taxpayers income is wage income, so payroll taxes dont take much of a bite.', 'it seems likely that much of this hypothetical persons income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate.', 'and, in fact, as buffett says, statistics from the internal revenue service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.on the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates.', 'it gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan tax policy center.buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if youre in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent.', 'and, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income.', 'were dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as buffett claims someone in his office now pays.', '(the top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the tax policy center.)', 'we contacted buffetts offices as berkshire hathaway about this point but didnt hear back.one final note: people who dont pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income.', 'when buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, hes thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.so when it comes to buffetts statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich.', 'and the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily

have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still cant

out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing nafta.', 'again, i have received a lot of incoming criticism from senator obama.', 'and the cleveland plain dealer examined senator

early 80s and i saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and hispanic -- and i worked on the streets of chicago to try to help them find jobs, i saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if theyre not properly structured, can be devastating.and as president of the united states, i intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the

both about nafta because the record, i think, is clear.', 'and i want to -- senator clinton.', 'senator obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance nafta has been good for new york and

renegotiate.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, you did in 2004 talk to farmers and suggest that nafta had been helpful.', 'the associated press today ran a story about nafta, saying that you have been consistently ambivalent towards the issue.', 'simple question: will you, as president, say to canada and mexico, this has not worked for us; we are out?sen.', 'obama: i will make sure that we renegotiate, in the same way that senator clinton talked about.', 'and i think actually senator clintons answer on this one is right.', 'i think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced.', 'and that is not what has been happening so far.that is something that i have been consistent about.', 'i have to say, tim, with respect to my position on this, when i ran for the united states senate, the chicago tribune, which was adamantly pro-nafta, noted that, in their endorsement of me, they were endorsing me despite my strong opposition to nafta.and that conversation that i had with the farm bureau, i was not ambivalent at all.', 'what i said was that nafta and other trade deals can be beneficial to the united states because i believe every u.s. worker is as productive as any worker around the world, and we can compete with anybody.', 'and we cant shy away from globalization.', 'we cant draw a moat around us.', 'but what i did say, in that same quote, if you look at it, was that the problem is weve been negotiating just looking at corporate profits and whats good for

pension, and are having to look for seven-buck-an-hour jobs at the local fast-food joint, that is devastating on them, but its also devastating on the community.', 'thats not the way that were going to prosper as we move forward.mr.', 'russert: senator, two journalists here in ohio wrote a piece called business as usual, which is very well known, suggesting it wasnt trade or manufacturing jobs that were being lost because of it, but rather business as usual: lack of patents, lack of innovation, lack of investment, 70 percent of the ph.d.s in biology, chemistry, engineering leaving the state.the fact is, exports now have the highest share of our national income ever.', 'ohio ranks fourth in terms of exports to canada and mexico.', 'are you sure this has not been better for ohio than youre suggesting?sen.', 'obama: im positive it hasnt been better for ohio.', 'but you are making a very legitimate point, which is, is that this trade (can/cant ?)', 'be the only part of our economic agenda.', 'but weve seen seven years in which we have a president who has been looking out for the well-heeled and people who are doing very well in the global economy, in the financial industries, in the telecommunications industries, and has not been looking out for ordinary workers.what do we have to do?', 'were going to have to invest in infrastructure to make sure that were competitive.', 'and ive got a plan to do that.', 'were going to have to invest in science and technology.', 'weve got to vastly improve our education system.', 'we have to look at energy and the potential for creating green jobs that can not just save on our energy costs but, more importantly, can create jobs in building windmills that will produce manufacturing jobs here in ohio, can put rural communities back on their feet by working on alternative fuels, making buildings more energy efficient.we can hire young people who are out of work and put them to work in the trade.', 'so there are all sorts of things that were going to have to do to make the united states economy much more competitive, and those are plans that i have put forward in this campaign and i expect to pursue as president of the united states of america.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, on the issue of jobs, i watched you the other day with your economic blueprint in wisconsin saying, this is my plan; hold me accountable.', 'and ive had a chance to read it very carefully.', 'it does say that you pledge to create 5 million new jobs over 10 years.and i was reminded of your campaign in 2000 in buffalo, my hometown, just three hours down route 90, where you pledged 200,000 new jobs for upstate new york.', 'theres been a net loss of 30,000 jobs.', 'and when you were asked about your pledge, your commitment, you told the buffalo news, i might have been a little exuberant.', 'tonight will you say that the pledge of 5 million jobs might be a little exuberant?advertisement continue reading the main storysen.', 'clinton: no, tim,

values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity.and as you know, despite the difficulties of the bush administration and a republican congress for six years of my first term i have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president i will have a lot more tools at my disposal.', 'and the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- i mean, this is not a big leap.', 'twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the clinton administration under my husband.', 'we can create at least 5 million new jobs.im not just talking about it.', 'i helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs.', 'i want to see people throughout ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and i know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the democrats wanted, as i originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those.you know, take a country like germany.', 'they made a big bet on solar power.', 'they have a smaller economy and population than ours.theyve created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that cant be outsourced.', 'these are jobs that have to be done in youngstown, in dayton, in cincinnati.', 'these are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through.', 'so i do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years.mr.', 'russert: brian?mr.', 'williams: senator obama, yesterday senator clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and im going to read you a quote from it.', 'quote, weve seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security.', 'we cannot let that happen again.', 'america has already taken that chance one time too many.', 'some of the comments in the speech were more pointed.', 'the senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of george w. bush at the same period.', 'provided you could be going into a general election against a republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair?sen.', 'obama: well, senator clinton i think equates experience with longevity in washington.', 'i dont think the american people do and i dont think that if you look at the judgments that weve made over the last several years that thats the accurate measure.', 'on the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into iraq -- i was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-american sentiment -- that it would distract us from afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and i do not believe it has made us more safe.al qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that john mccain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both senator clinton and i are talking about.', 'so on pakistan, during the summer i suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern pakistan.advertisement continue reading the main storyand many people said at the time well, you cant target those terrorists because musharraf is our ally and we dont want to offend him.', 'in fact, what we had was neither stability in pakistan nor democracy in pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in pakistan we would be much further along now than we are.', 'so on the critical issues that actually matter i believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that i think has been superior to senator clintons as well as senator mccains.mr.', 'williams: well, senator clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not senator obama was qualified to be commander in chief.', 'is your contention in this latest speech that america would somehow be taking a chance on senator obama as commander in chief?sen.', 'clinton: well, i have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in northern ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to beijing and standing up for womens rights as human rights and so much else.', 'and every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, senator obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. hes to be commended for having given the speech.', 'many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didnt have responsibility, he didnt have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way george bush was conducting the war.', 'and when he came to the senate, he and i have voted exactly the same.', 'we have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently.', 'so the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasnt just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference?', 'where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war?and on a number of other issues, i just believe that, you know, as senator obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan, which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take.', 'i have long advocated a much tougher approach to musharraf and to pakistan, and have pushed the white house to do that.and i disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it.so i think youve got to look at, you know, what i have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the senate armed services committee for now five years.', 'and i think that, you know, standing on that stage with senator mccain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, i will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really america must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country.mr.', 'williams: senator obama, a quick response.sen.', 'obama: let me just follow up.', 'my objections to the war in iraq were simply -- not simply a speech.', 'i was in the midst of a u.s. senate campaign.', 'it was a high-stakes campaign.', 'i was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and i was very specific as to why.and so when i bring this up, it is not simply to say i told you so, but it is to give you an insight in terms of how i would make decisions.advertisement continue reading the main storyand the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder.', 'it was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then weve voted the same way.', 'once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out.', 'the question is, whos making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch?', 'and the fact is that senator clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to george bush on day one on this critical issue.', 'so the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we cant afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the united states of america.with respect to pakistan, i never said i would bomb pakistan.', 'what i said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin laden or other key al qaeda officials, and we -- and pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should.', 'and just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al qaeda official.that is the position that we should have taken in the first place.', 'and president musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we dont know how the new legislature in pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy.and so my claim is not simply based on a speech.', 'it is based on the judgments that ive displayed during the course of my service on the senate foreign relations committee, while ive been in the united states senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, i think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against bush and cheney.', 'and that is how were going to be able to debate john mccain.', 'having a debate with john mccain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, i think, does not put you in a strong position.tim russert.sen.', 'clinton: well, i guess that --mr. russert: let me talk about the future -- let me talk the future about iraq, because this is important, i think, to democratic voters particularly.', 'you both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from iraq.', 'you both have said youd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al qaeda, to neutralize iran.', 'if the iraqi government said, president clinton or president obama, youre pulling out your troops this quickly?youre going to be gone in a year, but youre going to leave a residual force behind?', 'no.', 'get out.', 'get out now.', 'if you dont want to stay and protect us, were a sovereign nation.', 'go home now.', 'will you leave?sen.', 'obama: well, if the iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there.', 'this is a sovereign government, as george bush continually reminds us.now, i think that we can be in a partnership with iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of iraqis and to meet our national security interests.but in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why i have said that as soon as i take office, i will call in the joint chiefs of staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in.', 'we will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed.', 'we will provide them continued support.', 'but it is important for us not to be held hostage by the iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, thats distracting us from afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in america that will make us more competitive and more safe.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, if the iraqis said im sorry, were not happy with this arrangement; if youre not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'and i believe that there is no military solution that the americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the iraqi government.', 'and --mr. russert: let me ask -- let me ask you this, senator.', 'i want to ask you --sen. clinton: and they need to take responsibility for themselves.', 'and --mr. russert: i want to ask both of you this question, then.', 'if we -- if this scenario plays out and the americans get out in total and al qaeda resurges and iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as american president, to re-invade, to go back into iraq to stabilize it?sen.', 'clinton: you know, tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals.', 'and i believe that whats --mr. russert: but this is reality.sen.', 'clinton: no -- well, it isnt reality.', 'youre -- youre -- youre making lots of different hypothetical assessments.i believe that it is in americas interests and in the interests of the iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal.', 'ive been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and ive been pushing them to actually do it.', 'ive also said that i would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that i asked begun to be put together as soon as i became president.and i think we can take out one to two brigades a month.', 'ive also been a leader in trying to prevent president bush from getting us committed to staying in iraq regardless for as long as senator mccain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.so, when you talk about what we need to do in iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of america.', 'and i believe this is in the best interest.but i also have heard senator obama refer continually to afghanistan, and he references being on the foreign relations committee.', 'he chairs the subcommittee on europe.', 'it has jurisdiction over nato.', 'nato is critical to our mission in afghanistan.', 'hes held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato in afghanistan.you have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, i want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee.', 'but also, do you reserve a right as american president to go back into iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?sen.', 'obama: well, first of all, i became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. so it

that senator clintons been trying to make over the last several weeks.', 'you know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action.', 'and as i said in the last debate, ive spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and theyre seeking out the american dream.', 'thats how i started my career in public service, thats how i brought democrats and republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, thats how i helped to reform a welfare system that wasnt working in illinois, thats how ive provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so im very proud of that track record.and if senator clinton thinks that its all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at walter reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before i got to the senate.', 'and i changed that law.', 'or talk to those folks who i think have recognized that special interests are dominating washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in ohio.and so when i pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists cant get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of congress and they have to disclose who theyre getting money from and who theyre bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families.just one point ill make, i was in cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one.', 'and these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they dont have health care.', 'one of them doesnt have a job.', 'one of them is looking after an aging

senator clinton: what did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, i was having a little fun.', 'you know, its hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.but the larger point is that i know trying to get health insurance for every american thats affordable will not be easy.', 'its not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody its the right thing to do.', 'you know, 15 years ago i tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and i know it takes a fighter.', 'it takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests.you know, i have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies.', 'these have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the white house did, but because members of congress went along.', 'and i want to get that money back and invest it in the american middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout ohio, because what i hear as i go from toledo to parma to cleveland to, you know, dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but theyre not getting ahead.', 'they feel like theyre invisible to their government.', 'so when it came time to vote on dick cheneys energy bill, i voted no, and senator obama voted yes.', 'when it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which i think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- i voted yes and senator obama voted no.mr.', 'williams: and senator -- senator --sen. clinton: so part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight.', 'and i believe that i am a fighter, and i will fight for the people of ohio and the people of america.mr.', 'williams: what i was attempting to do here is to show something senator obama said about you, and im told its ready.mr.', 'russert: lets try it.mr.', 'williams: lets try it.', 'hang on.', 'watch your monitor.lets try it.', 'were going to come back to you.sen.', 'obama: but im going to have an opportunity to respond to this.sen.', 'obama: (from videotape.)', '-- herself as co-president during the clinton years.', 'every good thing that happened she says she was a part of.', 'and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.mr.', 'williams: now, senator obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but ive been wanting to ask you about this assertion that senator clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president.sen.', 'obama: well, i think what is absolutely true is, is that when senator clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, heres what i did.heres what we did.', 'heres what we accomplished -- which is fine.and i have not -- i have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and i dont begrudge her claiming that as experience.', 'what ive said, and what i would continue to maintain, is you cant take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like nafta, you say, well, i -- behind the scenes, i was disagreeing.', 'that doesnt work.', 'so you have to, i think, take both responsibility as well as credit.now there are several points that i think senator clinton made that i -- we need to discuss here.', 'first of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards.', 'keep in mind, i objected to the entire bill -- a bill that senator clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for.', 'and in one of the debates with you guys said, well, i voted for it, but i hoped it wouldnt pass -- which, as a general rule, doesnt work.', 'if you dont want it to pass, you vote against it.', '(laughter.', ')you know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care.', 'and look -- i do not in any way doubt that senator clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all americans.what i have said is that the way she approached it back in 93, i think, was wrong in part because she had the view that whats required is simply to fight.', 'and senator clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party.', 'and as a consequence, there were a number of people, like jim cooper of tennessee and bill bradley and pat moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations.', 'and we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done.i am absolutely clear that hope is not enough.', 'and it is not going to be easy to pass health care.', 'if it was, it would have already gotten done.', 'its not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country.', 'exxonmobil made $11 billion last quarter.', 'they are not going to give up those profits easily.but what i also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, were going to have to mobilize and inspire the american people so that theyre paying attention to what their government is doing.', 'and thats what ive been doing in this campaign, and thats what i will do as president.and theres nothing romantic or silly about that.', 'if the american people are activated, thats how change is going to happen.the second thing weve going to have to do is were actually going to have to go after the special interests.senator clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you cant just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away.', 'that is absolutely true, but it doesnt help if youre taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests.', 'they are less likely to go away.so it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence congress.', 'and yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the american people to get involved and pay attention.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word.', 'nothing more important.', 'last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out.', 'you checked yes on a questionnaire.', 'and now senator mccain has said, calling your bluff, lets do it.', 'you seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here.why wont you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election?sen.', 'obama: tim, i am not yet the nominee.', 'now, what ive said is, is that when i am the nominee, if i am the nominee -- because weve still got a bunch of contests left and senator clintons a pretty tough opponent.', 'if i am the nominee, then i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes.senator mccain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people arent exactly clear whether all the ts were crossed and the is were dotted.now what i want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign.', 'i said very early on i would not take pac money.', 'i would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists.', 'that -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because i had confidence that the american people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign.we have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50.', 'we average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the american people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody whos interested in good government and politics supports.mr.', 'russert: so you may opt out of public financing.', 'you may break your word.sen.', 'obama: what i -- what i have said is, at the point where im the nominee, at the point where its appropriate, i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility.', 'you have loaned your campaign $5 million.', 'you and your husband file a joint return.', 'you refuse to release that joint return, even though former president clinton has had significant overseas business dealings.your chief supporter here in ohio, governor strickland, made releasing his opponents tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, accountability, transparency.', 'if hes not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding?', 'we should question whats going on.why wont you release your tax return, so the voters of ohio, texas, vermont, rhode island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, the american people who support me are bankrolling my campaign.', 'thats -- thats obvious.', 'you can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that ive gotten.', 'and ever since i lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously.', 'im thrilled at so many people getting involved.', 'and were raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the internet.', 'and if anybodys out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to hillaryclinton.com, because thats whos funding my campaign.and i will release my tax returns.', 'i have consistently said that.', 'and i will --mr. russert: why not now?sen.', 'clinton: well, i will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, tim, because i have been as open as i can be.you have -- the public has 20 years of records for me, and i have very extensive filings with the senate where --mr. russert: so, before next tuesdays primary?sen.', 'clinton: well, i cant get it together by then, but i will certainly work to get it together.', 'im a little busy right now; i hardly have time to sleep.', 'but i will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain.mr.', 'russert: one other issue.', 'you talked about releasing documents.', 'on january 30th, the national archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady.', 'its now in the custody of former president clinton.', 'will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'ive urged that the process be as quick as possible.', 'its a cumbersome process, set up by law.', 'it doesnt just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position.', 'and i have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can.', 'now, also, president bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and i would urge the bush white house to move as quickly as possible.mr.', 'russert: but youve had it for more than a month.', 'will you get to him -- will you get it to the white house immediately?sen.', 'clinton: as soon as we can, tim.', 'ive urged that, and i hope it will happen.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments.on sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, chicago tribune: louis farrakhan backs obama for president at nation of islam convention in chicago.', 'do you accept the support of louis farrakhan?sen.', 'obama: you know, i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti-semitic comments.', 'i think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible.', 'i did not solicit this support.', 'he expressed pride in an african-american who seems to be bringing the country together.', 'i obviously cant censor him, but it is not support that i sought.', 'and were not doing anything, i assure you, formally or informally with minister farrakhan.mr.', 'russert: do you reject his support?sen.', 'obama: well, tim, you know, i cant say to somebody that he cant say that he thinks im a good guy.', '(laughter.)', 'you know, i -- you know, i -- i have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and i think that indicates to the american people what my stance is on those comments.mr.', 'russert: the problem some voters may have is, as you know, reverend farrakhan called judaism gutter religion.obama: tim, i think -- i am very familiar with his record, as are the american people.', 'thats why i have consistently denounced it.this is not something new.', 'this is something that -- i live in chicago.', 'he lives in chicago.', 'ive been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate.', 'and i have consistently distanced myself from him.russert: the title of one of your books, audacity of hope, you acknowledge you got from a sermon from reverend jeremiah wright, the head of the trinity united church.', 'he said that louis farrakhan epitomizes greatness.he said that he went to libya in 1984 with louis farrakhan to visit with moammar gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, your jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in hell.russert: what do you do to assure jewish-americans that, whether its farrakhans support or the activities of reverend jeremiah wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding israel and not in any way suggesting that farrakhan epitomizes greatness?obama: tim, i have some of the strongest support from the jewish community in my hometown of chicago and in this presidential campaign.', 'and the reason is because i have been a stalwart friend of israels.', 'i think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and i think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the united states is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the jewish community.and the reason that i have such strong support is because they know that not only would i not tolerate anti-semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what i want to do is rebuild what i consider to be a historic relationship between the african-american community and the jewish community.you know, i would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of jewish americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the south.', 'and that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened.but, you know, the reason that i have such strong support in the jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my u.s. senate campaign and its true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that i consistently have not only befriended the jewish community, not only have i been strong on israel, but, more importantly, ive been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable.when i was -- just last point i would make -- when i was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at ebenezer baptist church in conjunction with martin luther kings birthday in front of a large african-american audience, i specifically spoke out against anti- semitism within the african-american community.', 'and thats what gives people confidence that i will continue to do that when im president of the united states.williams: senator...clinton: i just want to add something here, because i faced a similar situation when i ran for the senate in 2000 in new york.', 'and in new york, there are more than the two parties, democratic and republican.', 'and one of the parties at that time, the independence party, was under the control of people who were anti-semitic, anti- israel.', 'and i made it very clear that i did not want their support.', 'i rejected it.', 'i said that it would not be anything i would be comfortable with.', 'and it looked as though i might pay a price for that.', 'but i would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either israel or jewish people in our country.and, you know, i was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of new york supported me and i won.', 'but at the time, i thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that.russert: are you suggesting senator obama is not standing on principle?clinton: no.', 'im just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it.', 'and theres a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'and i think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- i have no doubt that everything that barack just said is absolutely sincere.', 'but i just think, weve got to be even stronger.', 'we cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching.obama: tim, i have to say i dont see a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'theres no formal offer of help from minister farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it.', 'but if the word reject senator clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce, then im happy to concede the point, and i would reject and denounce.clinton: good.', 'good.', 'excellent.', '(applause)williams: rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing.were going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks.', 'well be back live from cleveland right after this.', '(commercial break)williams: we are back from cleveland state university.', 'we continue with our debate.the question beginning this segment is for you, senator obama.the national journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of ted kennedy.in a general election, going up against a republican party, looking for converts, republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than ted kennedy?obama: well, first of all, lets take a look at what the national journal rated us on.it turned out that senator clinton and i had differences on two votes.', 'the first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldnt go back, and i thought it was bad policy.the second -- and this, i think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- i supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the senate, because i thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the senate, that they werent being investigated by the senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it.this is something that ive tried to push as part of my ethics package.obama: it was rejected.', 'and according to the national journal, that position is a liberal position.now, i dont think thats a liberal position.', 'i think there are a lot of republicans and a lot of independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated.', 'so the categories dont make sense.and part of the reason i think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that senator obamas campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more independent votes than any other candidate in the democratic primary, and republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head?', 'its because people dont want to go back to those old categories of whats liberal and whats conservative.they want to see who is making sense, whos fighting for them, whos going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense?', 'thats what ive been doing, and thats why, you know, the proof is in the pudding.', 'weve been attracting more independent and republican support than anybody else, and thats why every poll shows that right now i beat john mccain in a match-up in the general election.williams: lets go from domestic to foreign affairs and tim russert.russert: before the primary on tuesday, on sunday, march 2, theres an election in russia for the successor to president putin.', 'what can you tell me about the man whos going to be mr. putins successor?clinton: well, i can tell you that hes a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by putin, who putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know.', 'you know, theres a lot of information still to be acquired.', 'that the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against putins hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising putin.', 'so this is a clever but transparent way for putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how were going to deal with russia going forward.i have been very critical of the bush administration for what i believe to have been an incoherent policy toward russia.', 'and with the reassertion of russias role in europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting irans nuclear ambitions, for example, its imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward russia.', 'but i have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by putin.russert: who will it be?', 'do you know his name?clinton: medvedev -- whatever.russert: yes.clinton: yes.russert: senator obama, do you know anything about him?obama: well, i think senator clinton speaks accurately about him.', 'he is somebody who was hand-picked by putin.', 'putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in russia in terms of running the government.', 'and, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of president bushs administration when he said -- you know, he met with putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him.he then proceeded to neglect our relationship with russia at a time when putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his european neighbors, as well as satellites of the former soviet union.', 'and so we did not send a signal to mr. putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us.', 'that is something that we have to change.russert: hes 42 years old, hes a former law professor.', 'he is mr. putins campaign manager.', 'he is going to be the new president of russia.', 'and if he says to the russian troops, you know what, why dont you go help serbia retake kosovo, what does president obama do?obama: well, i think that we work with the international community that has also recognized kosovo, and state that thats unacceptable.', 'but, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in nato to deal with this issue.we dont have to work in isolation.', 'and this is an area where i think that the clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned.obama: it has not been perfect, but it saved lives.', 'and we created a situation in which not only kosovo, but other parts of the former yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader european community.but, you know, be very clear: we have recognized the country of kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has great britain and many other countries in the region.', 'and i think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded.russert: before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service.', 'looking back through them, is there any words or vote that youd like to take back?senator clinton?clinton: well, obviously, ive said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding iraq was a sincere vote, i would not have voted that way again.i would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in iraq.', 'and i regret deeply that president bush waged a preemptive war, which i warned against and said i disagreed with.but i think that this election has to be about the future.', 'it has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what were going to inherit.you know, weve just been talking about russia.', 'we could have gone around the world.', 'we could have gone to latin america and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy.', 'we could have talked about africa and the failure to end the genocide in darfur.we could have gone on to talk about the challenge that china faces and the middle east, which is deteriorating under the pressures of hamas, hezbollah, and the interference that is putting israels security at stake.we could have done an entire program, tim, on what we will inherit from george bush.and what i believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of pennsylvania avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we dont have much time to try to make up for our losses.russert: but to be clear, youd like to have your vote back?clinton: absolutely.', 'ive said that many times.russert: senator obama, any statements or vote youd like to take back?obama: well, you know, when i first arrived in the senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding terri schiavo.', 'and i remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families.it wasnt something i was comfortable with, but it was not something that i stood on the floor and stopped.', 'and i think that was a mistake, and i think the american people understood that that was a mistake.', 'and as a constitutional law professor, i knew better.and so thats an example i think of where inaction...russert: this is the young woman with the feeding tube...obama: thats exactly right.russert: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not.obama: and i think thats an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action.but let me say this, since were wrapping up this debate.', 'we have gone through 20 debates now.', 'and, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and weve got four coming up, and maybe more after that.but the one thing im absolutely clear about is senator clinton has campaigned magnificently.', 'she is an outstanding public servant.', 'and im very proud to have been campaigning with her.and part of what i think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the american people.you know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics.', 'but when you spend as much time as senator clinton and i have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that peoples expectations are so modest.you know, theyre not looking for government to solve all of their problems.', 'they just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if theyre about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the american dream.you know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about.and, you know, i have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government.', 'thats why i think were both running, and im very pleased that ive had this opportunity to run with senator clinton.russert: but the voters can only choose one, brian.russert: and i think you have a question.williams: well, we dont have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but i am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both.', 'and ill ask it of you fist, senator obama.what is the fundamental question you believe senator clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in ohio and in texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee?', 'and then we will ask the same question of senator clinton.obama: i have to say, brian, i think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee.', 'now, i think id be better.', 'otherwise, i wouldnt be running.', 'but theres no doubt that senator clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than john mccain, who i respect and i honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of george bush over the last seven years.on economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we cant afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we cant afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe.', 'we cant afford it in terms of strategy.so i dont think that senator clinton has to answer a question as to whether shes capable of being president or our standard bearer.i will say this, that the reason i think im better as the nominee is that i can bring this country together i think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region.', 'and that is whats going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both senator clinton and i care so much about.and i also think i have a track record, starting from the days i moved to chicago as a community organizer, when i was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a united states senator, i think i bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the american people can have confidence that their voice is being heard.those are things -- those are qualities that i bring to this race, and i hope that the people of ohio, texas, rhode island and vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the united states.williams: senator clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question senator obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness?clinton: well, brian, there isnt any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the white house.as i said last week, you know, its been an honor to campaign.', 'i still intend to do everything i can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making.you know, obviously i am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which i think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous...(applause)... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are.so i feel that either one of us will make history.the question that i have been posing is, who can actually change the country?', 'and i do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see.you know, when i wasnt successful about getting universal health care, i didnt give up.', 'i just got to work and helped to create the childrens health insurance program.', 'and, you know, today in ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance.', 'and yet this morning in lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident.', 'and she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, will you help us?thats what my public life has been about.', 'i want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have.', 'and i will do whatever i can here in ohio, in texas, rhode island, in the states to come making that case.', 'because i think we do need a fighter back in the white house.you know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president.', 'its time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can.', 'and they deserve somebody who gets up in that white house and goes to bat for them.and thats what i will do.williams: senator, thank you.']","['thepeoplesview janeosanders cnnpolitics jane doesnt care shes going to rome for 10 minutes', 'postpolitics socialist satire that bernster what a

pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who’ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.and thats why were here.', 'two weeks ago, 12 of us from newtown came to meet with u.s. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence.', 'we came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many americans.', 'we met with dozens of democrats and republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on december 14th.expanded background checks wouldnt have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with “a” ratings from the nra -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of americans.', 'it‘s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.well return home now, disappointed but not defeated.', 'we return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen.', 'it will happen soon.', 'weve always known this would be a long road, and we dont have the luxury of turning back.', 'we will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.we take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the american people.on behalf of the sandy hook promise, i would like to thank president obama, vice president biden for their leadership and for

repeating the words with which the sandy hook promise begins: our hearts are broken.', 'our spirit is not.thank you.', 'it is now my great pleasure to introduce the president of the united states of america, barack obama.the president: a few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a united states congresswoman, gabby giffords, who’s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers –- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders –- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children.', 'and a few minutes ago, a minority in the united states senate decided it wasn’t worth it.', 'they blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the senate gallery.by now, it’s well known that 90 percent of the american people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun.', 'we’re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness.', 'ninety percent of americans support that idea.', 'most americans think thats already the law.and a few minutes ago, 90 percent of democrats in the senate just voted for that idea.', 'but it’s not going to happen because 90 percent of republicans in the senate just voted against that idea.a majority of senators voted “yes” to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks.', 'but by this continuing distortion of senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.i’m going to speak plainly and honestly about what’s happened here because the american people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen.', 'we had a democrat and a republican -– both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our second amendment, with “a” grades from the nra -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks.', 'and i want to thank joe manchin and pat toomey for their courage in doing that.', 'that was not easy given their traditional strong support for second amendment rights.as they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our second amendment rights.', 'all it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the internet.', 'so 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence.', 'and gabby giffords, by the way, is both -- she’s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence.', 'she is a westerner and a moderate.', 'and she supports these background checks.in fact, even the nra used to support expanded background checks.', 'the current leader of the nra used to support these background checks.', 'so while this compromise didn’t contain everything i wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress.', 'it represented moderation and common sense.', 'that’s why 90 percent of the american people supported it.but instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill.', 'they claimed that it would create some sort of “big brother” gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite.', 'this legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry.', 'plain and simple, right there in the text.', 'but that didn’t matter.and unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators.', 'and i talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they’re all good people.', 'i know all of them were shocked by tragedies like newtown.', 'and i also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun.', 'and i have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.but the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn’t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun.', 'there were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this.', 'it came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections.', 'they worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-second amendment.and obviously, a lot of republicans had that fear, but democrats had that fear, too.', 'and so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote “no.”one common argument i heard was that this legislation wouldn’t prevent all future massacres.', 'and that’s true.', 'as i said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil.', 'we learned that tragically just two days ago.', 'but if action by congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our second amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.and this legislation met that test.', 'and too many senators failed theirs.ive heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory.', 'and my question is, a victory for who?', 'a victory for what?', 'all that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check.', 'that didn’t make our kids safer.', 'victory for not doing something that 90 percent of americans, 80 percent of republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done?', 'it begs the question, who are we here to represent?ive heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced.', 'a prop, somebody called them.', '“emotional blackmail,” some outlet said.', 'are they serious?', 'do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don’t have a right to weigh in on this issue?', 'do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?so all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for washington.but this effort is not over.', 'i want to make it clear to the american people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the american people don’t give up on it.', 'even without congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities.', 'we’re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system.', 'we’re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job.', 'we’re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.but we can do more if congress gets its act together.', 'and if this congress refuses to listen to the american people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.to all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, democrats and republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don’t act this time, you will remember come election time.to the wide majority of nra households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in washington know they didn’t represent your views on this one.the point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe.', 'ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way.', 'but theyre better organized.', 'theyre better financed.', 'they’ve been at it longer.', 'and they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time.', 'and thats the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of americans support and you cant get it through the senate or the house of representatives.so to change washington, you, the american people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this.', 'and when necessary, you’ve got to send the right people to washington.', 'and that requires strength, and it requires persistence.and thats the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us.', 'i still dont know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they’ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.and i see this as just round one.', 'when newtown happened, i met with these families and i spoke to the community, and i said, something must be different right now.', 'we’re going to have to change.', 'thats what the whole country said.', 'everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didnt happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after aurora.', 'everybody talked about we needed change something after tucson.and i’m assuming that the emotions that we’ve all felt since newtown, the emotions that we’ve all felt since tucson and aurora and chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who’ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- i’m assuming thats not a temporary thing.', 'i’m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.i believe we’re going to be able to get this done.', 'sooner or later, we are going to get this right.', 'the memories of these children demand it.', 'and so do the
