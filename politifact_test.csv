politifact11709,"['democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton, bernie sanders and martin omalley went head-to-head on gun control, syria and the economy at a debate in manchester, n.h. dec. 19. here are the key moments.', '(monica akhtar/the washington post)three democratic candidates participated in tonights abc presidential primary debate at st. anselm college in new hampshire: hillary clinton, bernie sanders and martin omalley.we posted the complete transcript below, with insight from the crew here at the fix as well as the fact checkers michelle lee.click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript to see an annotation; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a genius account.', 'post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.the debate began after abcs martha raddatz and david muir introduced the candidates.raddatz: good evening to you all.', 'the rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance.', 'candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question.', 'for a rebuttal, for a follow-up, 45 seconds will be allowed.', 'there are green, yellow, and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when theyre supposed to be finished with their answers.muir: we will be tackling many critical issues right here tonight, and we begin with opening statements, in alphabetical order, and secretary clinton.clinton: well, thank you.', 'and im delighted to be here in new hampshire for this debate.you know, the american president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.', 'thats the job.', 'i have a strategy to combat and defeat isis without getting us involved in another ground war, and i have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.im very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our republican counterparts.', 'from my perspective, we have to prevent the republicans from rolling back the progress that weve made.', 'they would repeal the affordable care act, not improve it.', 'they would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.', 'and they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.so we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the democratic party, what we will do for our country, and i look forward to this evenings discussion of real issues that face the american people.thank you.raddatz: thank you, secretary clinton.', '(applause)governor omalley?omalley: martha, thank you.', 'tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign america has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, american lives taken from us.', 'so, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the united states is to protect the people of the united states.i visited with a number of our neighbors in northern virginia at a mosque last friday.', 'and as i looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, i also looked in the eyes of veterans.', 'i looked into the eyes of boy scouts.', 'i looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our countrys values and our freedoms.what our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.', 'and that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.', 'what our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as americans.we will rise to challenge of isil and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.', 'but we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.we are a better country than this.', 'our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the statue of liberty.', 'and americas best days are in front of us if we move forward together.', '(applause)muir: senator sanders.sanders: good evening.i am running for president of the united states because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.', 'im running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.', 'im running for president because im going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.im running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.', 'im running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.im running for president because i want a new foreign policy; one that takes on isis, one that destroys isis, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the middle east but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting muslim troops on the ground.', 'thats the kind of coalition we need and thats the kind of coalition i will put together.', '(applause)muir: senator sanders thank you and thank you all.we do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.senator sanders, you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the democratic national committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote, irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign.', 'the clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said, quote, our data was stolen.did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the clinton playbook?sanders: david, let me give you a little bit of background here.the dnc has hired vendors.', 'on two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.', 'our staff found information on our computers from the clinton campaign.', 'and when our staffers said, whoa, whats going here?', 'they went to the dnc quietly.they went to the vendor and said, hey, something is wrong, and that was quietly dealt with.', 'none of that information was looked at.', 'our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.a few days ago a similar incident happened.', 'there was a breach because the dnc vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.', 'in this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.', 'as soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.', 'we are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.thirdly, what i have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, i recognize it as a problem.', 'but what the dnc did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.', 'that is an egregious act.', 'im glad that late last night, that was resolved.sanders: fourthly, i work -- look forward to working with secretary clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because i am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.', 'dont know that.but we need an independent investigation, and i hope secretary clinton will agree with me for the need of that.last point.', 'when we saw the breach two months, we didnt go running to the media and make a big deal about it.', 'and it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the clinton campaign later.muir: but senator, you do mention the dnc -- the vender.', 'but you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing.sanders: absolutely.at abcs democratic presidential debate, candidate bernie sanders apologized to rival hillary clinton for a scandal involving key voter data.', '(abc news)muir: so, does secretary clinton deserve an apology tonight?sanders: yes, i apologize.muir: secretary clinton...(applause)sanders: not only -- not only do i apologize to secretary clinton -- and i hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- i want to apologize to my supporters.', 'this is not the type of campaign that we run.and if i find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.muir: secretary clinton, he has apologized.', 'how do your react?clinton: i very much appreciate that comment, bernie.', 'it really is important that we go forward on this.i know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- i said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.and so, now that, i think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.', 'because i dont think the american people are all that interested in this.', '(applause)i think theyre more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.omalley: yeah, david, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how were going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.', 'you want to know why things dont get done in washington?', 'because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how theyre even be able to buy presents for their kids.instead, were listening to the bickering back and forth.', 'maybe that is normal politics in washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.we need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.', 'and if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.', '(applause)muir (?', '): all three candidates are weighing in.sanders: let me agree with governor omalley and let me agree with secretary clinton.', 'you know, we had this incident before, secretary, with your famous e-mails.', 'right?and what i said and i think what governor omalley is saying, and i hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when were the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.', 'media notwithstanding.those are the issues that the american people want discussed.', 'i hope those are the issues well discuss.muir: good lets move on -- senator sanders, lets move on right to some of those issues.', '(applause)it is just six days before christmas, as we all know in this country.', 'its typically a joyful time, as it is this year, as well.', 'but its also an anxious time.', 'president obama has acknowledged that what we saw in san bernardino was an act of terrorism.', 'but we remember the president said, right before thanksgiving, there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland.we now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal.', 'they were not on law enforcements radar.', 'they were completely undetected.', 'so as we approach another holiday, with the president again saying, late this week, no credible threat, secretary clinton, how confident should the american people be, that there arent others like that couple right now in the u.s. going undetected?and what would you do as president to find them?clinton: well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of america safe.i have a plan that ive put forward to go after isis.', 'not to contain them, but to defeat them.', 'and it has three parts.', 'first, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both syria and iraq.clinton: secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.', 'and thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.', 'under each of those three parts of my plan, i have very specific recommendations about what to do.obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an american-led air campaign, we have to have arab and kurdish troops on the ground.', 'secondly, weve got to go after everything from north africa to south asia and beyond.and then, most importantly, here at home, i think there are three things that we have to get right.', 'we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.', 'that now includes the internet, because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.', 'they cant see the government as an adversary, we cant see them as obstructionists.', 'weve got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what theyre planning.and we must work more closely with muslim-american communities.', 'just like martin, i met with a group of muslim-americans this past week to hear from them about what theyre doing to try to stop radicalization.', 'they will be our early warning signal.', 'thats why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the republicans have been doing.omalley: david, i am the very first...muir: (inaudible) thank you.', '(applause)i am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor.', 'i understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like san bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders.many of the things secretary clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing.', 'not only in theater, in syria and iraq and other places where we embalk (ph) ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies.i believe that whats happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but its a lack of battle tempo.', 'we have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future.muir: and were going to break down these issues tonight, but i do want to go to senator sanders because the concern going into christmas is significant, as you know.', 'a new abc news poll shows 77 percent of americans have little or no confidence in the governments ability to prevent a lone wolf attack.', 'how would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected?sanders: im one of the 77 percent.', 'i think this is a very difficult issue.', 'let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.', 'let me tell you what i think we have got to do.', 'i think its a two-pronged issue.number one, our goal is to crush and destroy isis.', 'what is the best way to do it?', 'well, i think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.', 'i voted against the war in iraq because i thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the middle east.i do not believe in unilateral american action.', 'i believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the muslim nations.', 'i think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the middle east is king abdullah ii of jordan.', 'this small country has welcomed in many refugees.and abdullah said something recently, very important.', 'he said, yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of islam.', 'we the muslims should lead the effort on the ground.', 'and i believe he is absolutely right.muir: senator, thank you.raddatz: secretary clinton, in the wake of the san bernardino attack, you all emphasized gun control.', 'but our latest poll shows that more americans believe arming people, not stricter gun laws, is the best defense against terrorism.', 'are they wrong?clinton: well, i think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.', 'clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.', 'you know, when senator sanders talks about a coalition, i agree with him about that.', 'weve got to build a coalition abroad.', 'we also have to build a coalition at home.', 'abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on isis.', 'i know how hard that is.', 'i know it isnt something you just hope people will do and ive worked on that...raddatz: secretary clinton, can we stick to gun control?clinton: yes, im getting...raddatz: are they wrong?clinton: ... im getting to that.', 'because i think if you only think about the coalition abroad youre missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.', 'guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make americans safer.', 'we lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what i think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.i think what is...(applause)is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.', 'the first line of defense against radicalization is in muslim-american community.', 'people who we should be welcoming and working with.i worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the republicans, particularly donald trump, is sending a message to muslims here in the united states and literally around the world that there is a clash of civilizations, that there is some kind of western plot or even war against islam, which then i believe fans the flames of radicalization.so guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how were going to deal with the radicalization here in the united states.', '(crosstalk)raddatz: senator sanders -- wait just a moment, please, governor omalley.senator sanders, weve seen those long lines of people buying guns in record numbers after the paris attacks.', 'would you discourage people from buying a gun?sanders: its a country in which people choose to buy guns.', 'i think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of vermont, my guess here in new hampshire, are gun owners.', 'thats the right of people.but this is what i do believe.', 'i believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, i believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in san bernardino, but in colorado and movie theaters in colorado, i think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.for example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the american people say we should strengthen the instant background check.', 'who denies that it is crazy...(applause)who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?', 'weve got to eliminate the gun show loophole.', 'in my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.i think there is a consensus.', '(applause)i think -- im not going to say that everybody is in agreement.', 'its a divided country on guns.', 'but there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that i, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.omalley: martha, if i may...raddatz: thank you, senator sanders.', '(crosstalk)raddatz: i think were going to go on...omalley: excuse me, no.muir: governor, we have to abide the rules here, well call on you here shortly, but...omalley: i am the only person on this stage who has actually...muir: but i do want pick up on something...omalley: ... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, david.and, look, there are profound differences...(applause)omalley: senator sanders voted against the brady bill.', 'senator sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.', 'and senator sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.secretary clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against president obama and saying we dont need federal standards.look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.', 'we need more principle.', 'when isil does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the united states of america is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.', 'we need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.raddatz: governor, now -- and let me stay with gun control for a minute, then.', 'you talk about assault weapons.', 'even if you were able to ban the purchase of assault weapons tomorrow, americans already own an estimated 7 to 10 million semi-automatic rifles.would you make it illegal to own those weapons, force people to turn them in?', 'and if not, how would banning the sales really make a difference?omalley: because, martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.', 'you know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...raddatz: but, again, im not talking about buying.', 'would you have them confiscated?', 'the ones that are already here?omalley: no, martha, i would not.', 'and thats not what we did in maryland.', 'but you know what we did in maryland?', 'we overcame the nras objections.', 'we overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.we did our own rallies.', 'and at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.', 'isil videos, isil training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in america is at a gun show.and its because of the flip-flopping, political approach of washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.sanders: whoa, whoa, whoa.', 'lets calm down a little bit, martin.clinton: yes, lets tell the truth, martin.omalley: i am telling the truth.sanders: first of all, lets have some rules here, commentators.muir: we will.', '(laughter)sanders: all right.muir: but let me just establish that for you, senator.', 'really quickly governor, we are going to call on you tonight and its very clear you have a lot to say but please wait until youre called upon.', 'and senator, he invoked your record and ill let you respond.sanders: he sure did.muir: ill let you respond.clinton: he invoked mine as well.muir: and you will get some to as well.sanders: sure did.', 'all right.', 'first off, we can do all the great speeches we want but youre not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.', 'in 1988, just to set the record straight governor, i ran for the u.s. house.', 'we have one house member from vermont, three candidates in the race.', 'one candidate said, you know what, i dont think its a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not bernie sanders.', 'i lost that election by three percentage points.', 'quite likely, for that reason.', 'so please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.', '(crosstalk)excuse me.', 'do not tell me that i have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now were in a position to create a consensus in america on gun safety.', '(applause)muir: senator, thank you.', 'i want to move on here.', 'secretary clinton, you brought up donald trump a short time ago.clinton: i do and this is an important issue and i know well get to a lot of other critical ones as well.', 'i actually agree with governor omalley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.', 'and i applaud his record in maryland.', 'i just wish he wouldnt misrepresent mine.', 'i have been for the brady bill, i have been against assault weapons.i have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.', 'and i also know that -- and im glad to see this -- senator sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what were confronting in our country.', 'i know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.and i would hope, senator sanders, that you would join the democrats who are trying to close the charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.', 'we need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.', 'its no longer enough just to say the vast majority of americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.we need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the republican side will even admit theres a problem.', 'and in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.', '(applause)muir: secretary clinton, thank you.', 'were going to move on from guns here and go back to something you mentioned a short time ago.', 'you brought up donald trump first here this evening.', 'weve now seen the polling done well after his proposed ban on muslims coming to america.', 'thirty-six percent of americans, more than a third, agree with him.you have weighed in already on donald trump.', 'youve weighed in on the proposed ban.', 'but what would you say to the millions of americans watching tonight who agree with him?', 'are they wrong?clinton: well i think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what theyre seeing.', 'first what they saw in paris, now what they have seen in san bernardino.', 'and mr. trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.so what i would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.', 'we need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if its suspicious, reporting what you hear.', 'making sure that muslim americans dont feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.clinton: you know, i was a senator from new york after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.', 'one of the best things that was done, and george w. bush did this and i give him credit, was to reach out to muslim americans and say, were in this together.', 'you are not our adversary, you are our partner.and we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that trump is sending around the world dont fall on receptive ears.', 'he is becoming isiss best recruiter.', 'they are going to people showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.', 'so i want to explain why this is not in americas interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.muir: secretary, thank you.senator sanders, i did want to ask you about a neighbor in san bernardino who reportedly witnessed packages being delivered to that couples home, that it set off red flags, but they didnt report it because they were afraid to profile.', 'what would you say to americans afraid to profile?', 'is it ever acceptable?sanders: well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.', 'thats kind of a no-brainer.', 'you know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, i think its a good idea to call 911. do it.', '(laughter)muir: but im asking about -- im asking about profiling.', 'because a lot of people are afraid of that.sanders: but i want to talk -- i want to talk about something else, because secretary clinton i think made some interesting and good points.', 'what you have now is a very dangerous moment in american history.the secretary is right: our people are fearful.', 'they are anxious on a number of levels.', 'they are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on america.', 'we all understand that.but you know what else theyre anxious about?', 'theyre anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, theyre worried about their kids, and theyre seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.', 'and theyre looking around them, and theyre looking at washington, and theyre saying the rich are getting much richer, im getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?', 'what are you going to do for my kids?and somebody like a trump comes along and says, i know the answers.', 'the answer is that all of the mexicans, theyre criminals and rapists, weve got to hate the mexicans.', 'those are your enemies.', 'we hate all the muslims, because all of the muslims are terrorists.', 'weve got to hate the muslims.', 'meanwhile, the rich get richer.so what i say to those people who go to donald trumps rallies, understand: he thinks a low minimum wage in america is a good idea.', 'he thinks low wages are a good idea.i believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.', 'lets create an america that works for all of us, not the handful on top.', '(applause)muir: senator, thank you.raddatz: i want to move to another...omalley: martha, may i -- martha, may i...(crosstalk)raddatz: no, no, not yet, governor omalley.omalley: can i share this quick story?raddatz: no, not yet, governor omalley.omalley: oh.', 'all right.raddatz: ill come to you when we call on you.', 'thank you very much.omalley: when you come back to me, ill share that story.raddatz: youll be happy.', 'ill let -- ill let you talk then.secretary clinton, i want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the paris attacks, encryption.', 'fbi director james comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order.youve talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but apple ceo tim cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data.', 'so would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?clinton: i would not want to go to that point.', 'i would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see theyre not adversaries, theyve got to be partners.it doesnt do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.', 'there must be some way.', 'i dont know enough about the technology, martha, to be able to say what it is, but i have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.and maybe the back door is the wrong door, and i understand what apple and others are saying about that.', 'but i also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we cant know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.clinton: i just think theres got to be a way, and i would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.', 'otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.so we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but i know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.', 'and thats what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.raddatz: and governor omalley, where do you draw the line between national security and personal security?omalley: i believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.', 'we need to figure this out together.', 'we need a collaborative approach.', 'we need new leadership.the way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.', 'the federal government should have to get warrants.', 'thats not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.but at the same time with new technologies i believe that the people creating these projects -- i mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our american principles and values.my friend kashif, who is a doctor in maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.', 'he was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.', 'and he is a proud american muslim.', 'and one of his little boys said to him, dad, what happens if donald trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?', 'these are very, very real issues.', 'this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.we need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.', 'and we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as donald trump.raddatz: thank you, governor omalley.muir: martha, were going to turn now to refugees coming to america.', 'and on the subject of refugees, more than half of all americans now say they oppose taking in refugees from syria and across the middle east.secretary clinton, you have said that it would undermine who we are as americans, shutting our doors.', 'but new hampshires governor, where we are right here tonight, a democrat and a supporter of yours, is among more than 30 governors who are now concerned.', 'governor maggie hassan says, we should halt acceptance of syrian refugees until u.s. authorities can assure the vetting process, halt syrian refugees.', 'is she wrong?clinton: well, i agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...muir: but a halt?clinton: i dont think a halt is necessary.', 'what we have to do is put all of our resources through the department of homeland security, through the state department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.', 'now, this takes, david, 18 months to 24 months, two years.so i know its not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.', 'but the process should move forward while we are also taking on isis, putting together the kind of strategy that ive advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.', 'because i do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we dont want to sacrifice our values.we dont want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.', 'so i want us to have a very tough screening process but i want that process to go forward.', 'and if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and i would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.', 'i would prioritize them.and that would i think give the american public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.muir: governor omalley, obviously you were governor yourself at one time.', 'what would you say to new hampshires governor tonight?', 'is she wrong on this?omalley: no, what i would say is this is look, i was the first of the three of us to call for america to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.', 'and if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.muir: so the idea of a halt or a pause?', '(applause)omalley: david, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.', 'i met recently with some members of the chaldean christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.', 'there is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.', 'we need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.omalley: what these chaldean families told me was that their families in syria, when isis moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family youd better get out now.', 'the sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.we need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the statue of liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.muir: governor, thank you.raddatz: senator sanders -- senator sanders, were going to move on.', 'were going to move on.sanders: excuse me.', 'may i have a chance to respond to this issue?raddatz: were going to move on to the fight against isis.', 'youre the one who told us we have to follow the rules and break it off.', '(laughter)sanders: yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.', 'all right.', '(laughter)raddatz: ok. lets keep going.', 'thank you.sanders: all right.', 'lets keep going.', 'ok.raddatz: thank you.', 'i do want to move to the fight against isis.sanders: yeah.raddatz: for the people of new hampshire, the brutality of isis is personal.', 'james foley grew up here.', 'the first hostage, a journalist, brutally executed last year.', 'youve all said isis is a ruthless enemy and must be stopped.', 'al qaida as well.senator sanders, you voted to send u.s. ground forces to fight in the coalition to help destroy al qaida in afghanistan.', 'can you then explain you why dont support sending u.s. combat troops to join a coalition to fight isis?sanders: and i also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.i voted against the first gulf war, which set the stage, i believe, for the second iraq war.', 'and what i believe right now, and i believe this is terribly important, is the united states of america cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when theres an international crisis all over the world, in france and in the u.k. or -- hey, just call up the american military and the american taxpayers, theyre going to send the troops.and if they have to be in the middle east for 20 or 30 years no problem.raddatz: but why al qaida, why not isis?sanders: i have a problem with that, martha.', 'what i believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including russia, a well-coordinated effort.but i agree, as i mentioned a moment ago, with king abdullah.', 'this is a war for the soul of islam.', 'the troops on the ground should not be american troops.', 'they should be muslim troops.', 'i believe that countries like saudi arabia and qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy isis with american support.raddatz: the administration has tried that over and over again.', 'if it doesnt work and this threat is so great, whats your plan b?sanders: my plan is to make it work, to tell saudi arabia that instead of going to war in yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on earth, are going to have to go to war against isis.to tell qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the world cup, maybe they should pay attention to isis, which is at their doorstep.', '(applause)raddatz: secretary clinton, you too have ruled out a large u.s. combat force, yet you support sending in special operations forces to syria, and sending those 100 to 200 troops to iraq to do exploitation kill raids.weve already lost one delta force member in a raid.', 'it has looked very much to me like were already in ground combat on frequent trips ive made there.so, are you fooling americans when you say, were not putting american combat troops back into syria or iraq?clinton: no.', 'not at all.', 'i think that what were facing with isis is especially complicated.', 'it was a different situation in afghanistan.', 'we were attacked from afghanistan.', 'al qaida was based in afghanistan.', 'we went after those who had attacked us.whats happening in syria and iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in baghdad, led by maliki, there has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis.', 'and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants.theyve advertised that.', 'they want american troops back in the middle east.', 'they want american soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.clinton: so, i think its absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining were going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis.and we do have to form a coalition.', 'i know how hard that is.', 'i have formed them.', 'i put together a coalition, including arabs, with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran.', 'and you have to really work hard at it.and the final thing i would say, bringing donald trump back into it, if youre going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of isis you dont want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.', 'and so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.', '(applause)raddatz: secretary clinton, i want -- i want to follow up on that.', 'you do support sending special operations forces there.', 'you support what the president has done already.', 'one of the lessons people draw from vietnam and war since is that a little force can turn into a little more and a little more.', 'president obama certainly didnt expect to be sending 30,000 additional troops into afghanistan the first year of his presidency.are you prepared to run the risk of a bigger war to achieve your goals to destroy isis, or are you prepared to give up on those goals if it requires a larger force?clinton: well, i just think youre asking a question with a false choice.', 'i believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the iraqi army, which has had some recent success in ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after al qaida in iraq, if we get the turks to pay more attention to isis than theyre paying to the kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that i am outlining, i think we can be successful in destroying isis.so thats what im focused on, thats what ive outlined and thats what i would do as president.raddatz: governor omalley.', '(applause) youve emphasized the need for more human intelligence on the ground.', 'what is it our intelligence community is not doing now that needs to be done?omalley: well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.', 'and what im talking about is not only the covert cia intelligence, im also talking about diplomatic intelligence.', 'i mean, weve seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.so what i would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we dont greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.', 'as president, i would make the administrator of usaid an actual cabinet member.', 'we have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as general dempsey said.and i do believe, and i would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.', 'they have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of syria and iraq.', 'we cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.and youve seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the african union and the things that they have done to better stabilize somalia.', 'we need to pay attention here in central america as well.', 'so this is the new type of threats that were facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.clinton: well, i just want to quickly add...raddatz: thank you.clinton: martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why i have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from assads forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from isis.', 'and of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the russians, who are also flying in that space.im hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the security council, which embodies actually an agreement that i negotiated back in geneva in june of 2012, were going to get a diplomatic effort in syria to begin to try to make a transition.', 'a no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.raddatz: secretary clinton, id like to go back to that if i could.', 'isis doesnt have aircraft, al qaida doesnt have aircraft.', 'so would you shoot down a syrian military aircraft or a russian airplane?clinton: i do not think it would come to that.', 'we are already de-conflicting air space.', 'we know...raddatz: but isnt that a decision you should make now, whether...clinton: no, i dont think so.', 'i am advocating...raddatz: ... if youre advocating this?clinton: i am advocating the no-fly zone both because i think it would help us on the ground to protect syrians; im also advocating it because i think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with russia.now that russia has joined us in the security council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in geneva three years ago, now i think we can have those conversations.', 'the no-fly zone, i would hope, would be also shared by russia.', 'if they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of assad toward isis and put the assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.', '(crosstalk)muir: i want to take this to senator -- im going to take this to senator sanders next, because i think there...(crosstalk)sanders: i have a difference of opinion with secretary clinton on this.', 'our differences are fairly deep on this issue.', 'we disagreed on the war in iraq.', 'we both listened to the information from bush and cheney.', 'i voted against the war.but i think -- and i say this with due respect -- that i worry too much that secretary clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.yes, we could get rid of saddam hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.', 'yes, we could get rid of gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for isis.', 'yes, we could get rid of assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit isis.', 'so i think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.', 'but before you do that, youve got to think about what happens the day after.', 'and in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that were not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of assad, a terrible dictator.', 'but i think in syria the primary focus now must be on destroying isis and working over the years to get rid of assad.', 'thats the secondary issue.clinton: that is exactly...muir: senator, thank you.clinton: that is exactly what i just said and what i just described.muir: yeah, but, secretary clinton -- secretary clinton...clinton: and that is important, because now we have a u.n. security council that will enable us to do that.', 'and, you know, with all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to libya.', 'you joined the senate in voting to get rid of gadhafi, and you asked that there be a security council validation of that with a resolution.all of these are very difficult issues.', 'i know that; ive been dealing with them for a long time.', 'and, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like gadhafi, a despot with american blood on his hands, is overturned.', 'but ill tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our european partners and our arab partners to assist the people in libya, you would be looking at syria.', 'now the libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge isis from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.sanders: i was not the secretary of state...muir: senator sanders, senator sanders, hold on.', 'one moment, please.', 'im going to ask the secretary here, because there does appear to be some daylight here between the policies, at least in respect to when you take out syrian president bashar al-assad.', 'right now or do you wait?', 'do you tackle isis first?you have said, secretary clinton, that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once.', 'we heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of assad and come together with countries, including russia and iran, to destroy isis first.', 'is he wrong?clinton: i think were missing the point here.', 'we are doing both at the same time.muir: but thats what hes saying, we should put that aside for now and go after isis.clinton: well, i dont agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in syria to dislodge isis if the fighters there who are not associated with isis, but whose principal goal is getting rid of assad, dont believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.', 'we now have that.', 'we have the u.n. security council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.', 'its very important we operate on both at the same time.and let me just say a word about coalition-building, because ive heard senator sanders say this.', 'i know how hard it is to build coalitions.', 'i think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more iranian troops inside syria.', 'that is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.the iranians getting more of a presence in syria, linking with hezbollah, their proxy in lebanon, would threaten israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with assads future.', '(crosstalk)sanders: i happen to think...omalley: id like to offer a...(applause)muir: she says we have to proceed on both fronts at once.sanders: secretary clinton is right.', 'this is a complicated issue.', 'i dont think anyone has a magical solution.but this is what i do believe.', 'yes, of course assad is a terrible dictator.', 'but i think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.', 'the immediate -- it is not assad who is attacking the united states.', 'it is isis.', 'and isis is attacking france and attacking russian airliners.the major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of isis.', '(applause)and i think -- and i think we bring together that broad coalition, including russia, to help us destroy isis.', 'and work on a timetable to get rid of assad, hopefully through democratic elections.', 'first priority, destroy isis.muir: senator sanders, thank you.omalley: may i offer a different generations perspective on this?muir: governor omalley?omalley: during the cold war -- during the cold war, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the u.s. jersey.', 'we got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the united states.', 'look what we did in iran with mosaddegh.', 'and look at the results that were still dealing with because of that.', 'i would suggest to you that we need to leave the cold war behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.i mean, i know secretary clinton was gleeful when gadhafi was torn apart.', 'and the world, no doubt is a better place without him.', 'but look, we didnt know what was happening next.', 'and we fell into the same trap with assad, saying -- as if its our job to say, assad must go.we have a role to play in this world.', 'but we need to leave the cold war and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.muir: but -- you criticized -- you criticized secretary clinton for what came next.', 'whats your proposal for what comes after assad?omalley: i believe that we need to focus on destroying isil.', 'that is the clear and present danger.', 'and i believe that we can springboard off of this new u.n. resolution, and we should create, as secretary clinton indicated, and i agree with that, that there should be a political process.but we shouldnt be the ones declaring that assad must go.', 'where did it ever say in the constitution, where is it written that its the job of the united states of america or its secretary of state to determine when dictators have to go?we have a role to play in this world.', 'but it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.', '(crosstalk)sanders: david...clinton: since he has been making all kinds of comments.', '(laughter)i think its fair to say, assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 syrians.', 'the reason we are in the mess were in, that isis has the territory it has, is because of assad.i advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when i was still secretary of state, because i worried we would end up exactly where we are now.and so, when we look at these complex problems, i wish it could be either/or.', 'i wish we could say yes, lets go destroy isis and lets let assad continue to destroy syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.no.', 'we now finally are where we need to be.', 'we have a strategy and a commitment to go after isis, which is a danger to us as well as the region... sanders (?', '): secretary...clinton: and we finally have a u.n. security council resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in syria.sanders: could i just say -- just say this...clinton: if the united states does not lead, there is not another leader.', 'there is a vacuum.sanders: can i just say this...clinton: and we have to lead, if were going to be successful.', '(applause)muir: senator sanders, please.', 'go ahead.senator sanders, a last word on this.sanders: of course the united states must lead.', 'but the united states is not the policeman of the world.', 'the united states must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the middle east.', 'the united states, at the same time, cannot successfully fight assad and isis.isis, now, is the major priority.', 'lets get rid of assad later.', 'lets have a democratic syria.', 'but the first task is to bring countries together to destroy isis.muir: senator sanders, thank you.', 'when we come back here tonight, the other major issues of this election: jobs, the economy, health care.which candidates will make the best case for the middle class, as our coverage of the democratic debate, here in new hampshire, continues right after this on abc.announcer: abc news coverage of the new hampshire democratic debate will continue in a moment.', '(commercial break)muir: welcome back tonight.', 'as you can see, we have a packed audience here in new hampshire and were going to continue.', 'weve already had a spirited conversation here at the top of the broadcast about isis, about the concerns of terror here on the homefront and as we await secretary clinton backstage, were going to begin on the economy.we want to turn to the american jobs, wages and raises in this country.', 'and we believe secretary clinton will be coming around the corner any minute.', 'but in the mean time we want to start with this eye-opening number.', 'and senator sanders, this question goes to you first, anyway.in 1995, the median american household income was $52,600 in todays money.', 'this year, its $53,600.', 'thats 20 more years on the job with just a 2 percent raise.', 'in a similar time-frame, raises for ceos went up more than 200 percent.', '(applause)clinton: sorry.muir: were going to continue here, and secretary, youll get a chance on this too.but as i pointed out the ceo pay, 200 percent of their time -- for that family of just 2 percent.', 'youve all said, you would raise the minimum wage.', 'but senator sanders what else - speak to that household tonight.', '20 years, just a 2 percent raise, how as president would you get them a raise right away?sanders: first of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as youve indicated.', 'middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when bush left office?', 'absolutely.', 'but as youve indicated for millions of american workers, people in new hampshire -- all over america, theyre working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.', 'so what do we do?first statement is, we tell the billionaire class, they cannot have it all.', 'for a start, theyre going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.', 'second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.', 'next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.', 'women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.', 'we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.', 'that is why im going to have a tax on wall street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in america are tuition free.muir: senator sanders, thank you.governor omalley, what would propose that would be different, how would you get the middle class a raise and without waiting another 20 years for another 2 percent.omalley: look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.', 'we actually passed a living wage.', 'we raised the minimum wage.', 'we actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market american capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.all through the recession, we defended the highest median income in america and the second highest median income for african american families.', 'how?', 'by actually doing more for education.', 'we increased education funding by 37 percent.we were the only state in american that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.', 'we invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.', 'we created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.omalley: so david, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they werent hopes, they werent dreams, they werent amorphous goals out there.', 'we actually took action to do these things and as president, i have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all american families.', 'universal national service is an option for every kid in america to cut youth employment.and im the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for americas cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great american cities and get them back to work.muir: governor, thank you.', 'secretary clinton...(applause)as you were walking in, i was talking about the median american household getting a two percent raise over the last 20 years, that ceo pay in that same time frame has gone up 200 percent.', 'so for those families watching tonight, how do you get them a raise if youre president?clinton: well, ive been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because its bad for our economy, were a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and its bad for our democracy.', 'its absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.i think its great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because youre not going to hear anything like this from any of the republicans who are running for president.', '(applause)they dont want to raise the minimum wage, they dont want to do anything to increase incomes.', 'at the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people havent been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.of course we have to raise the minimum wage.', 'of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with market basket right here in new hampshire and new england, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.', '(applause)and weve got to do more on equal pay for equal work.', 'that means pass the paycheck fairness act so we have transparency about how much people are making.', 'thats the way to get womens wages up, and thats good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.', '(applause)and there is a lot we can do in college affordability.', 'i have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.', 'i also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.', 'and theres a lot.', 'you can go to my website...muir: secretary...clinton: ... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.', 'but i guess the final thing that -- that i would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the republicans in the fall.muir: secretary, thank you.', '(applause)clinton: this is the election...muir: were going to -- were going to...clinton: ... issues they have to respond to.muir: and were going to talk about college education in a moment.', 'but secretary clinton, i did want to ask you, the last time you ran for president, fortune magazine put you on its cover with the headline business loves hillary, pointing out your support for many ceos in corporate america.', 'im curious, eight years later, should corporate america love hillary clinton?clinton: everybody should.', '(laughter)(applause)look, i have said i want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.', 'i want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.', 'i want the buffett rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.', 'i want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.but i also want to create jobs and i want to be a partner with the private sector.', 'im particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.', 'my dad was a small businessman, a really small business.', 'i want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.', 'so if -- if people who are in the private sector know what i stand for, its what i fought for as a senator, its what i will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we dont get the american economy moving and growing, were not going to recognize our country and were not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.muir: secretary, thank you.', 'senator sanders...(applause)i want to stay on this and ask you how big a role does corporate america play in a healthy economy and will corporate america love a president sanders?sanders: no, i think they wont.', '(laughter)(applause)so hillary and i have a difference.', 'the ceos of large multinationals may like hillary.', 'they aint going to like me and wall street is going to like me even less.', '(applause)and the reason for that is weve got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on wall street.', 'when you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, weve got to re- establish glass-steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.sanders: so i dont think...(applause)... having said that, i dont think im going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from wall street.', 'i dont have a super pac.', 'i dont want campaign contributions from corporate america.and let me be clear: while there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and i say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of wall street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of americans.', 'we need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and i will fight and lead to make that happen.muir: senator, thank you.', 'i want to...(applause)(crosstalk)muir: governor, let me just ask you, though, because it is an important question, how important a role do you think corporate america plays in a healthy economy here in the u.s.?omalley: look, i look at our economy as an ecosystem.', 'and the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.', 'and most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.but there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.', 'were not going to fix what ails our economy, were not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace american capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of wall street-directed crony capitalism.and for my part, i have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on wall street in ways that secretary clinton never, ever has.', 'in fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with wall street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.i believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.', 'theres mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and its bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.and the worst type of concentration, secretary clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you werent responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.and thats why today you still cannot support, as i do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day glass- steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.', 'and i was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...clinton: ok...muir: governor omalley, thank you.', '(crosstalk)muir: i do want to ask you, secretary clinton.', 'let me just ask you...clinton: let me respond...muir: we did -- we did -- secretary clinton, let me just ask you...(crosstalk)clinton: under the rules, i have been -- i have been invoked, david, so let me respond very quickly.', 'number one...muir: and in particular...(crosstalk)clinton: number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in new hampshire.', 'they started in iowa.', 'now, youd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?', 'and the answer is: because they know i will go right after them, that i will not let their agenda be americas agenda.secondly, i think its important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.', 'you can go to opensecrets.org and check that.', 'i have more donations from students and teachers than i do from people associated with wall street.', '(applause)now, number three -- and let me say this -- when governor omalley was heading the democratic governors association, he had no trouble at all going to wall street to raise money to run campaigns for democratic governors.', 'and he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.so, you know, again, the difference between us and the republicans is night and day.', 'and there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the sec and the commodities future trading commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of lehman brothers, and that was senator sanders.so if were going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every american.', 'and if that means taking on wall street, i have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both senator sanders and governor omalley are proposing.sanders: let me just -- let me just...muir: secretary clinton, thank you.sanders: let me just jump in.', 'my name was invoked.muir: senator?sanders: so with that invocation, let me say a few words.', '(laughter)secretary clinton, i dont have a super pac.', 'i dont get any money from wall street.', 'you have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from wall street.', 'but most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.', 'ill advertise my web site as well.', '(laughter)and what youll find is that i led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the house financial committee against alan greenspan, against a guy named bill clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you dont.', '(laughter)against the republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.', 'what a brilliant idea that would be.go to youtube.', 'find out what i said to greenspan.', 'at the end of the day, if teddy roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.wall street today has too much political power.', 'it has too much economic power.', 'to get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.muir: senator sanders...sanders: wall street is a threat to the economy.', 'theyve got to be broken up.', '(applause)muir: thank you, senator.', 'raddatz: and were going to move on to health care.secretary clinton, the department of health and human services says more than 17 million americans who are not insured now have health coverage because of obamacare.', 'but for americans who already had health insurance the cost has gone up 27 percent in the last five years while deductibles are up 67 percent, health care costs are rising faster than many americans can manage.whats broken in obamacare that needs to be fixed right now?', 'and what would you do to fix it?clinton: well, i would certainly build on the successes of the affordable care act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.', 'we have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldnt find at any affordable price health care.women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.', 'and we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.', '(applause)those are all really positive developments.', 'but out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.', 'and so what i have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.number two, i want medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries health systems.', '(applause)we end up paying the highest prices in the world.', 'and i want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the affordable care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.and i think thats an important point to make because im going through and analyzing the points you were making, martha.', 'we dont have enough competition and we dont have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.', '(crosstalk)raddatz: but you did say those were glitches.clinton: yes.raddatz: just glitches?clinton: well, theyre glitches because...raddatz: twenty-seven percent in the last five years, deductibles up 67 percent?clinton: it is.', 'because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.', 'we have fought, as democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.', 'i know.', 'ive got the scars to show from the effort back in the early 90s.we want to build on it and fix it.', 'and im confident we can do that.', 'and it will have effects in the private market.', 'and one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend medicaid.and so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.', 'those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.', '(crosstalk)raddatz: senator sanders, i want you to respond to what she was saying, but youre instead calling for single-payer health care.sanders: yes, exactly, exactly.raddatz: you note people wont have to pay deductibles or premiums but they will have to pay new taxes.', 'can you tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay?sanders: yes, well, roughly.', 'let me say this.', 'as a member of the health education committee that helped write the affordable care act, much of what secretary clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.seventeen more million more people have health care.', 'it is a step forward.', 'a step forward.but this is what we also have to say.', 'not only are deductibles rising, 29 million americans still have no health insurance and millions of people cant afford to go to the doctor.', 'major crisis and primary health care.', 'here is the bottom line.', 'why is it that the united states of america today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?why is it...(applause)sanders: why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the u.k., 50 percent more than what they pay in france, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.', 'bottom line.this ties into campaign finance reform.', 'the insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the united states congress.', 'we need to pass a medicare for all single payer system.', 'it will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.raddatz: senator sanders, you didnt really tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay...sanders: but they will not be paying, martha, any private insurance.', 'so its unfair to say in total...raddatz: but you cant tell us this specifically, even if you were...sanders: i can tell you that adding up the fact youre not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.', 'the average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.', 'raddatz: ok. lets go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the new hampshire institute of politics, right here at saint anselm college, neil levesque.neil?levesque: here to new hampshire again.', 'as you know, this auditorium is filled with many saint anselm college students.', 'they know the outstanding student debt right now in america is $1.3 trillion.', 'that private education costs have gone up in the last decade 26 percent, and 40 percent for public education.so knowing that, we know you want to make public education more affordable but how do you really lower the cost?', 'senator sanders, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you want free tuition for public colleges.sanders: and universities.levesque: how does that really lower the cost other than just shifting the cost to taxpayers?sanders: well, neil, i think weve got to work on a two-pronged approach.', 'and your point is absolutely well taken.', 'the cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.', 'there are a lot of factors involved in that.and that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.', 'maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.', 'but...(applause)sanders: and i understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.', 'but, bottom line is this is the year 2015. if we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.it is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.', 'millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.', 'what do we do?my proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.', 'you have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.what sense is that?', 'so i think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.', 'we should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.', 'all young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.', '(applause)levesque: governor omalley, how do you propose -- governor omalley, how do you propose lowering some of these costs associated with higher education?omalley: yes, this one falls under the category of, i have actually done this.', 'as a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuition.my plan actually goes further than senator sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.', 'so as a nation we need to increase what we invest in pell grants.', 'yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.omalley: but states need to do more as well.', 'and i propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.', 'i believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.im joined tonight by two daughters, tara and grace.', 'my oldest daughters a teacher.', 'man (ph), their mothers here as well.', 'we were proud of them on graduation day, werent we, katie?', 'and were going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.i mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.', 'therere families all across america who arent able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.', 'i also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after world war ii on a g.i.', 'bill.but today, were the only nation on the planet thats saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.', 'thats a drag on the economy.', 'its one of the key investments we need to make.', 'i was flattered that secretary clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.', 'and in our party, unlike the republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.muir: secretary clinton.clinton: right.mcelveen: secretary clinton, how does your plan differentiate from your opponents?clinton: well, i have what i call the new college compact.', 'because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education.', 'in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.', 'so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.', 'so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.secondly, i dont believe in free tuition for everybody.', 'i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.', 'so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.', 'so i put all of this together, again, on my website and ive gotten such a good response.but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.', 'free college, a single payer system for health, and its been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.', 'and i think weve got to be really thoughtful about how were going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how im going to pay for it; including college.mcelveen: thank you secretary clinton, thank you.sanders: may i respond to the critique on the ...mcelveen: back to you david.muir: were going to get right into this senator but i want to ask about taxes next.', 'this is included.sanders: i would just...muir: she was asking about that...sanders: but secretary clinton is wrong.as you know, because i know you know a lot about health care.', 'you know that the united states per capita pays far and away more than other country.', 'and it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the secretarys clinton proposal.clinton: well, the only thing - the only thing i can go on senator sanders...muir: are we back on health care - secretary clinton hold one moment.', 'senator sanders...(crosstalk)clinton: your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.muir: secretary clinton, please.clinton: and my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.', 'im the only person...muir: so lets ask about it.secretary clinton, lets turn to the taxes.clinton: ... saying, no middle class tax raises.', 'thats off the table...muir: this is where we are going next, we are going next to taxes here...sanders: now, this is getting to be fun.muir: this is fun.', '(applause)this is democracy at work.secretary clinton, let me ask you about your tax plan because from the crushing cost of college education, the next question most families have; is will my taxes go up under the next president?', 'you have said its your goal not to raise taxes on families making under $200,000 a year a goal.', 'but can you say thats a promise as you stand here tonight?clinton: that is a pledge that im making.', 'i made it when i ran in 2008.muir: a promise?clinton: yes, and it was the same one that president obama made.', 'because i dont think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families taxes.we just heard that most families havent had a wage increase since 2001. since, you know, the end of the last clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.', 'and weve got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and i dont think a middle-class tax should be part of anybodys plan right now.sanders: let me respond to...(applause)muir: secretary clinton...sanders: let me respond to...muir: please.sanders: number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.now, when secretary clinton says, im not going raise taxes on the middle class, let me tell you what she is saying.', 'she is disagreeing with fdr on social security, lbj on medicare and with the vast majority of progressive democrats in the house and the senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the united states being the only major country on earth that doesnt provide paid family and medical leave.what the legislation is is $1.61 a week.', 'now, you can say thats a tax on the middle class.', 'it will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.', 'i think, secretary clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.muir: senator, thank you.', 'let me bring in governor omalley...clinton: senator, i have been -- i have been fighting for paid...muir: youve heard...clinton: ... family leave for a very long time...muir: secretary clinton.sanders: david, thank you.clinton: i have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...sanders: then (inaudible)...clinton: ... not everybody else.sanders: every (inaudible) democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, kirsten gillibrand, rosa delauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.muir: thank you.', 'i want to bring in governor omalley on this.', 'we heard the promise from secretary clinton because people want to know about their taxes, will they go up.', 'she has now promised here tonight not to raise them on families making $250,000 or less.', 'can you make that same promise if youre elected?omalley: no, ive never made a promise like that.', 'but unlike either of these two fine people, ive actually balanced a budget every single year.', 'i was one -- i was the only -- one of only seven states that had a aaa bond rating.', 'by the time i left, the average tax burden on maryland families was the same as when i started.but i did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.', 'david, look, this is the big -- i agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.', 'and i agree with senator sanders on that.', 'and just like social security and unlike the republicans, i think we should actually expand social security and increase average monthly benefits.but look, theres one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that theyre entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.if we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.so the things i have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.', 'thats the issue that we need to tackle as americans, and we can do it and we know how.muir: governor omalley, thank you.', 'a spirited debate on taxes.', 'and there will be more with the democratic debate in new hampshire, when we come back right here on abc.', 'more in a moment.', '(commercial break)muir: welcome back tonight to new hampshire.', 'the democratic debate continues here on abc.and secretary clinton, we want to turn to race, now, in america.', 'there is a real concern in this country from black lives matter and from other community groups that were just now seeing, with smartphones and cell phones, what many have been dealing with for years when they come in contact with police.but you also have many in law enforcement who now say there has been a so-called ferguson effect, police holding back because theyre afraid of backlash.muir: in fact, the fbi director is calling it a chill wind blowing through american law enforcement.', 'so, if elected president, how would you bridge the divide between the two?clinton: well, david, i think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.', 'we have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.i feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.', 'trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.at the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and theyre acting heroically.', 'the young officer who was killed responding to the planned parenthood murders.', 'the officer who told the victims of the san bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.so i think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that president obama impaneled.', 'we need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.and we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.muir: secretary, thank you.', '(applause)muir: governor omalley, how would you bridge the divide?omalley: there is no issue in american public policy that i have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in america.when i ran in 1999, david, for mayor of baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in america.', 'but we came together.', 'i brought people together over some very deep racial divides.', 'and we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in america over the next ten years.as governor, we continued to work together.', 'we reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.', 'but get this.', 'we also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.', 'so it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and its also possible to improve how we police our police.but there wasnt a single day as mayor of baltimore that i wasnt asked whether i was delivering on the promise i made to police the police.', 'we reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.', 'in fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.as a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.', 'just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.theres so much work that can be done, so much weve learned to do better.', 'we need to do it now as a nation.', 'this is our time and our opportunity to do that.muir: governor, thank you.', '(applause)muir: and senator sanders, when you hear the fbi director calling it a chill wind blowing through american law enforcement, does that concern you as well when you --sanders: well, this whole issue concerns me.', 'and i agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.', 'but lets be clear.', 'today in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.', 'predominantly african-american and hispanic.we are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow americans.', 'i think, and this is not easy, but i think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.', 'we need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.', 'now, what does that mean?well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly african-americans.', '(applause)sanders: it means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why i have taken marijuana out of the controlled substance act.', 'so that it will not be a federal crime.sanders: that is why we need to make...(applause)that is why we need to make police -- and i speak as a former mayor.', 'i was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.', 'and what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.we need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.', 'we need to end minimal sentencing.', 'we need, basically, to pledge that were going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.', '(applause)muir: senator, thank you.', 'we want to turn now to an issue.this next issue has destroyed so many families across the country, and in particular right here in new hampshire, heroin.', 'and theres a stunning new figure out.', 'a recent poll -- 48 percent here, in this state alone, say they know someone who has abused heroin.were going to turn tonight to dan tuohy of the new hampshire union leader who has this question.question: new hampshire has been hard hit by the heroin epidemic, and were on track to have twice as many overdose deaths this year as in 2013.what specifically would you do to address this crisis?muir: senator sanders, im going to take this to you first because youve seen whats happened with heroin right on the border in your own state.sanders: yes.', 'look, this is a tragedy for new hampshire.', 'it is a tragedy for my state of vermont.', 'it is a tragedy all over this country.', 'the number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.what do we do?', 'well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but i think we have got to

dealing with the states id requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued id.', 'the court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it.', 'however, the id requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit.part of this litigation — and any rational debate about the issue generally — hinges on two things: costs and benefits.', 'the costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others).', 'the ostensible benefits, though, are all the same.', 'and in addressing these purported benefits, the wisconsin supreme court blew it.', 'twice.first, the court cited the idea that id laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater.', 'it turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot.', 'people in states with more restrictive id laws don’t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states.', 'people who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they’re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing id rules in their area.', 'the factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair?', 'whether their preferred candidates win.', '[here’s the completely legal way to ‘rig’ an election]second, the court said that id laws can help stop fraud.', 'it then cited an example of recent fraud … that id laws aren’t designed to stop.', 'specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of wisconsin governor scott walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didnt live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials, according to an account by talking points memo.', 'wisconsins id law would not likely have

243-page document that mississippi state sen. chris mcdaniel filed on monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the mississippi republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that id can stop.instead, requirements to show id at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot.', 'this is a slow, clunky way to steal an election.', 'which is why it rarely happens.i’ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud id laws are

investigated (including some prosecutions).', 'but many have not.', 'based on how other claims have turned out, i’d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook.in just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest id laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of id.', '(that doesn’t include

have a new opportunity.the question for you, senator clinton: would you be willing to sit down with raul castro, or whoever leads the cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?clinton: well, jorge, i hope we have an opportunity.', 'the people of cuba deserve to have a democracy.', 'and this gives the cuban government, under raul castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.im going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.of course the united states stands ready.', 'and, as president, i would be ready to reach out and work with a new cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.i want to bring the region together, our european allies who have influence with cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the united states will welcome that.clinton: and as president, i would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.but there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.ramos: very simply, would you meet with him or not, with raul castro?clinton: i would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because i think its important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction.', 'then i think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.but weve had this conversation before, senator obama and myself, and i believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate.', 'but a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the cuban people.brown: senator obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous cnn debate that you would meet with the leaders of cuban, iran, north korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of cuba.obama: thats correct.', 'now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in cuba should be the liberty of the cuban people.', 'and i think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the castro regime.', 'and we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the united states and cuba after over half a century.i would meet without preconditions, although senator clinton is right that there has to be preparation.', 'it is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press.', 'and that preparation might take some time.but i do think that its important for the united states not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies.', 'in fact, thats where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.', '(applause)obama: one other thing that ive said, as a show of good faith that were interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what ive called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in cuba.and i think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but i would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that senator clinton was talking about.brown: but thats different from your position back in 2003. you called u.s. policy toward cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.brown: so youve backtracked now...obama: i support the eventual normalization.', 'and its absolutely true that i think our policy has been a failure.', 'i mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and senator clintons entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of cuba.so i think that we have to shift policy.', 'i think our goal has to be ultimately normalization.', 'but thats going to happen in steps.', 'and the first step, as i said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.and then i think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in cuba, but i think this principle applies generally.', 'i recall what john f. kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate.', 'and this moment, this opportunity when fidel castro has finally stepped down, i think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.', '(applause)brown: senator clinton, do you want a quick response?clinton: well, i agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone.', 'ive been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with iran, for a number of years.because i think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community.', 'its in our interests.', 'its in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like cuba, like iran.but there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations.', 'and it should be part of a process, but i dont think it should be offered in the beginning.', 'because i think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like raul castro or ahmadinejad and others.clinton: and, as president kennedy said, he wouldnt be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.and therefore, i do think we should be eliminating the policy of the bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.so i would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and i would use bipartisan diplomacy.', 'i would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because i want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the bush administration is over and were going to...(applause)brown: very briefly and then were going to move on.', '(applause)obama: i think, as i said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting.', 'and i think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the bush unilateralism thats caused so much damage.but i do think it is important precisely because the bush administration has done so much damage to american foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, i think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time.', 'and i think that its important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.obama: that is the kind of step that i would like to take as president of the united states.', '(applause)brown: a question now on the economy.john king?cnns john king: campbell, senators, good evening, first.i want to bring the conversation back home.', 'you know from your travels -- you dont need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.for some, that is a question about: what should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession?', 'for some, it is more focused.', 'maybe it is: will you raise the minimum wage?', 'maybe its about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, senator obama.but when we ask democrats, how are these two candidates different?, they even think they dont know.senator obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a president obama be different than a president clinton in managing the nations economy?obama: well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: you dont need an economist or the federal reserve to tell the american people that the economys in trouble, because theyve been experiencing it for years now.everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.and so people have been struggling for a long time.', 'in some communities, they have been struggling for decades now.', 'so this has to be a priority of the next president.now, what ive said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.number one, with our tax code: weve got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the united states of america.', '(applause)we have to end the bush tax cuts to the wealthy...(applause)... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class americans and working americans who need them.obama: so ive said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, i want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary americans.', 'senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldnt have to pay income tax on your social security.we pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.', '(applause)on our trade deals, i think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of wall street, but also main street, which means weve got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we dont have toys being shipped in the united states with lead paint on them.', '(applause)so these are all issues that ive talked about repeatedly, and i think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy.', 'we send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.obama: and for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work.', 'so...(applause)now, i dont want to take too much time.', 'and im sure well be spend more time discussing this.senator clinton and i, i think, both agree on many of these issues.', 'and i think its a credit to the democratic party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.i think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.the question people are going to have to ask is: how do we get it done?and it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if were able to form a working coalition for change.', 'because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist.', 'the special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.and i think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that im talking about.obama: and thats an area where senator clinton and i may have a slight difference.', 'but im happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything thats been left out.king: lets give senator clinton that opportunity then.', '(applause)as you have campaigned, senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, i am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.the clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that youre ready; hes not.what would you do differently on day one than a president obama would when it comes to managing the nations economy?clinton: well, i would agree with a lot that senator obama just said, because it is the democratic agenda.clinton: we are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.were going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of texas, ohio or anywhere else to another country.were certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.you know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and i think its time that the rest of america had a president to work for you every single day.', '(applause)we will also have a different approach toward trade.were going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but i want to have a trade time-out.', 'were going to look and see whats working and whats not working, and id like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.were also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market.', 'were going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.clinton: now, in addition, there are steps i would take immediately.', 'one is on this foreclosure crisis.', 'i have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders.', 'but we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.everywhere i go, i meet people who either have been or about to lose their home.', '85,000 homes in foreclosure in texas; 90,000 in ohio.', 'ive met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom whos going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasnt fair to him.so i would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and i would freeze interest rates for five years.', 'because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of americans are going to be homeless.', 'and vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of texas and america.', '(applause)clinton: now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.clean green jobs; ive been promoting this.', 'i wanted it to be part of the stimulus package.', 'i thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of americans to work helping to create our future.we also need to invest in our infrastructure.', 'we dont have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels.', 'we need to rebuild america, and that will also put people to work.and, finally, we need to end george bushs war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...(applause)brown: thank you, senator.', 'and weve got a lot of ground to cover...clinton: this is about how we fund the future.', 'weve got to get back to being the innovation nation.', 'think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...(applause)brown: all right.', 'senator clinton, thank you very much.brown: and, as i was saying, weve got a lot to get through.', 'so i do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in texas, which is immigration.and, jorge, you have a question.ramos: (speaking in spanish) federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million u.s.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?clinton: i would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions youre referring to.but when we see whats been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the america that i know.', '(applause)clinton: that is against american values.', 'and it is...(applause)and it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government.', 'we need comprehensive immigration reform.', 'i have been for this.', 'i signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. ive been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but lets do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.id like to see more federal help for communities like austin and others like laredo, where i was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.and i personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning english.if they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported.', 'but for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization.', 'i would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.', '(applause)brown: senator obama, is your position the same as hillary clintons?obama: there are a couple of things i would add.', 'comprehensive immigration reform is something that i have worked on extensively.two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the senate.', 'i was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the house this year.', 'because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.and so there are a couple of things that i would just add to what senator clinton said.number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.oftentimes, it has been directed at the hispanic community.', 'we have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in washington, and that is unacceptable.we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things.', 'so we need comprehensive reform...(applause)... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security.', 'it means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they cant complain if theyre not paid a minimum wage.obama: they cant complain if theyre not getting overtime.', 'worker safety laws are not being observed.we have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesnt lead to people with spanish surnames being discriminated against, so theres got to be a safeguard there.we have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn english, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that theyre going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now weve got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.', '(applause)and whats worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if youve got a hard working immigrant family, theyve got to hire a lawyer; theyve got to pay thousands of dollars in fees.', 'they just cant afford it.', 'and its discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but dont have the money.', 'so weve got to fix that.obama: so weve got to fix that.the second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with mexico and work with the mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.and the problem that we have...(applause)the problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a u.s.- mexican relationship.', 'and, frankly, president bush dropped the ball.', 'he has been so obsessed with iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in mexico, but for all people.', 'and thats as policy that im going to change when im president of the united states.', '(applause)brown: all right, senator obama.were going to stay with this topic.', 'i want to have john king ask another question.go ahead, john.king: i want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in washington, and that is the border fence.king: to many americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security.', 'america should be able to keep people out that it doesnt want in.but, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people its a much more personal question.', 'it could be a question of their livelihood.', 'it could be a question of cross-border trade.', 'it might be an issue to a rancher of property rights.', 'it might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence.', 'as you know, progress has been slow.as president of the united states, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think its time for a president of the united states to raise his or her hand and say, you know what?', 'wait a minute.', 'lets think about this again.', 'do we really want to do this?clinton: well, i think both senator obama and i voted for that as part of the immigration debate.clinton: and having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night i was at the university of texas at brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the bush administration.', 'because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.', '(applause)and what i learned last night when i was there with congressman ortiz is that the university of texas at brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.this is the kind of absurdity that were getting from this administration.', 'i know it because ive been fighting with them about the northern border.', 'their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.so what ive said is that i would say, wait a minute, we need to review this.', 'there may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.i think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered.', 'but as with so much, the bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that i think is counterproductive.clinton: so i would have a review.', 'i would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...(applause)... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.', '(applause)brown: let me go on, again -- john?king: does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?because, as you know, when they first built the fence in the san diego area, it only went so far.', 'and what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved.', 'and californias problem became arizonas problem.', '(laughter)clinton: but, you know, john, there is -- theres a lot weve learned about technology and smart fencing.', 'you know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.clinton: it requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.i think that the way that the bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.so what i have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work.', 'but lets deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.i frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.brown: all right.clinton: and the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.brown: all right, senator clinton.', '(applause)senator obama, go ahead please.obama: well, this is an area where senator clinton and i almost entirely agree.', 'i think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether its on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.and the bush administration is not real good at listening.', 'thats not what they do well.', '(laughter)and so i will reverse that policy.', 'as senator clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing.', 'but for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, thats going to be the better approach.the one thing i do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, i think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.obama: senator clinton and i have both campaigned in places like iowa and ohio and my home state of illinois, and i think that the american people want fairness, want justice.', 'i think they recognize that the idea that youre going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that were not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...(applause)... to sending people back.but what they do also want is some order to the process.', 'and so, were not going to be able to do these things in isolation.', 'were not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we dont also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.and thats why i think comprehensive reform is so important.', 'thats the kind of leadership that ive shown in the past; thats the kind of leadership that ill show in the future.one last point i want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: something that we can do immediately that i think is very important is to pass the dream act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.obama: i do not want two classes of citizens in this country.', '(applause)i want everybody to prosper.', 'thats going to be a top priority.', '(applause)brown: ok, weve got one last question on immigration.jorge, go ahead.ramos: (speaking spanish) right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak spanish.', '(applause)many of them are right here.', 'by the year 2050, there will be 120 million hispanics in the united states.', 'now, is there any downside, senator clinton, to the united states becoming (speaking spanish) becoming a bilingual nation?', 'is there a limit?clinton: well, i think its important for as many americans as possible to do what i have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.i think it is important, though, that english remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the american experience and pursue the american dream.you know, i have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make english the official language.', 'that i do not believe is appropriate, and i have voted against it and spoken against it.clinton: i represent new york.', 'we have 170 languages in new york city alone.', 'and i do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak english, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.but i do think that english does remain an important part of the american experience.', 'so i encourage people to become bilingual.', 'but i also want to see english remain the common, unifying language of our country.', '(applause)ramos: senator obama, is there any down side to the united states becoming a bilingual nation?obama: well, i think it is important that everyone learns english and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country.', 'i think thats very important.i also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...(applause)... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, i want to make sure that children who are coming out of spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.obama: if bilingual education helps them do that, i want to give them the opportunity.but i also want to make sure that english-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of americas continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and thats something frankly where weve fallen behind.one of the failures of no child left behind, a law that i think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.', '(applause)and foreign languages is one of those areas that i think has been neglected.', 'i want to put more resources into it.brown: all right.were going to take a quick break.', 'weve got to go to a commercial.', 'well be back with a lot more.', 'there is also a debate we should mention raging online right now.', 'go to our web site, cnnpolitics.com, and join in.', 'the debate here at the university of texas in austin continues right after this.', '(commercial break)brown: and we are back.', 'were here in austin, texas, the capital city.', 'welcome back to the texas democratic debate at the university of texas, austin.the first question now goes to john king.king: senator, as im sitting here, were about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and im having what i like to call one of those parallel universe moments.ive been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually.', 'and the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse weve had tonight.', '(laughter)(applause)and so, i want to ask you about that.', 'there are times when each of you seems to call into question the other ones credibility or truthfulness.and, senator clinton, i want to talk specifically about some words youve spoken here in the state of texas over the past couple of days.youve said, quote, my opponent gives speeches; i offer solutions.you said the choice for democrats in this campaign is, quote, talk versus action.now, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the wheres the beef?', 'question.but, since were in texas, id like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and youve used yourself in the context of president bush.', 'are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?clinton: well, i have said that about president bush, and i think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.', '(applause)you know, i think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, senator obama and i have a lot in common.', 'we both care passionately about our country.', 'we are devoted to public service.', 'we care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, i think, very positive and extremely civil.clinton: but there are differences between us.', 'and i think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.and i do offer solutions.', 'thats what i believe in and what i have done.', 'and its what i offer to voters because its part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference.', 'because i think that this country has given me so much.and there are differences between our records and our accomplishments.', 'i have to confess, i was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the tv shows, one of senator obamas supporters couldnt.so i know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us.', 'and its important that voters get that information.', 'so, yes, i do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words.', 'and i offer...(applause)brown: senator obama, go ahead.brown: senator obama, do you want to respond?obama: well, i think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service i have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didnt have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...(applause)... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and its not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.you know, i think if you talk to those wounded warriors at walter reed who, prior to me getting to the senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while theyre recovering from amputations, i think theyve said that ive engaged not just in talk, but in action.', '(applause)obama: now, i think that senator clinton has a fine record and i dont want to denigrate that record.', 'i do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about.', 'senator clinton of late has said: lets get real.', 'the implication is that the people whove been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.', '(laughter)and that, you know, the 20 million people whove been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of texas.', '(applause)obama: you know, the thinking is that somehow, theyre being duped, and eventually theyre going to see the reality of things.well, i think they perceive reality of whats going on in washington very clearly.', 'what they see is that if we dont bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated washington, then we will not get anything done.', 'and the reason that this campaign has done so well...(applause)the reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.obama: senator clinton and i share a lot of policy positions.', 'but if we cant inspire the american people to get involved in their government and if we cant inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.im running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.', '(applause)brown: i think one of the points -- i think one of the points that john king was alluding to in talking about some of senator clintons comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter deval patrick, the governor of massachusetts, and senator clintons campaign has made a big issue of this.', 'to be blunt, theyve accused you of plagiarism.obama: right.brown: how do you respond?obama: well, look, the -- first of all, its not a lot of speeches.', 'there are two lines in speeches that ive been giving over the last couple of weeks.ive been campaigning now for the last two years.', 'deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that i share, that words are important.', 'words matter.', 'and the implication that they dont i think diminishes how important it is to speak to the american people directly about making america as good as its promise.', 'barbara jordan understood this as well as anybody.obama: and the notion that i had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...(applause)... who gave me the line and suggested that i use it, i think, is silly, and...(applause)... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and i think people start getting discouraged about it...(laughter)... and they dont want...(applause)what they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?how are we going to provide health care to the american people?how are we going to make sure that college is affordable?so what ive been talking about, in this speeches -- and ive got to admit, some of them are pretty good.', '(applause)what ive been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration.', 'its a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...(applause)... so that college becomes more affordable.obama: ive been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief.', 'i have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the united states.', '(applause)so just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which i have been working on for years now.', 'senator clinton has a fine record.', 'so do i. im happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldnt be spending time doing is tearing each other down.', 'we should be spending time lifting the country up.', '(applause)brown: senator clinton, is it the silly season?clinton: well, i think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words.', 'thats, i think, a very simple proposition.', '(applause)and, you know, lifting whole passages from someone elses speeches is not change you can believe in, its change you can xerox.', 'and i just dont think...obama: come on.', '(crosstalk)clinton: no, but, you know, but, barack, it is.because, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the youtube of these videos, it does raise questions.now, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and i applaud you for that.', 'but when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.clinton: it is not enough to say, lets come together.', 'we know were going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.you know, when i proposed a universal health care plan, as did senator edwards, we took a big risk, because we know its politically controversial to say were going to cover everyone.and you chose not to do that.', 'you chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people.', 'thats a big difference.when i said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldnt work.and, you know, in the last week, even president bush has said we have to do something like that.i just believe that weve got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after george bush leaves the white house.clinton: the world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone.', 'we all know that.', '(applause)but then weve got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time.', 'you know, when i took on...(applause)when i took on universal health care back in 93 and 94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition.', 'i was more than happy to do that, because i believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every american.i dont want to leave anybody out.', 'i see the results of leaving people out.', 'i am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in america.', '(applause)brown: all right, senator clinton, thank you.senator obama, please respond.', '(applause)obama: well, i think that senator clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where weve got some differences.', 'im happy to debate those, which is what i think should be the focus of this campaign.', 'we both want universal health care.when i released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and senator clinton said we all want universal health care.', 'of course, i was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good.', 'its not as good now, but my plan hasnt changed.', 'the politics have changed a little bit.we both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar.', 'we both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of congress.', 'and we are going to subsidize those who cant afford it.obama: were going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention.', 'and i want to make sure that were applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.now, i also want to make sure that were reducing costs for those who already have health insurance.', 'so we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.so weve got a lot of similarities in our plan.', 'weve got a philosophical difference, which weve debated repeatedly, and that is that senator clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.and my belief is, the reason that people dont have it is not because they dont want it but because they cant afford it.and so i emphasize reducing costs.', '(applause)and as has been noted by many observers, including bill clintons former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who cant have it.obama: now, there are legitimate arguments for why senator clinton and others have called for a mandate, and im happy to have that debate.but the notion that i am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all americans, and that is simply not true.', 'we think that theres going to be a different way of getting there.one last point i want to make on the health care front.', 'i admire the fact that senator clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. she deserves credit for that.', '(applause)but i said before, i think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasnt just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were.', 'it was also that senator clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of democratic members of congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that senator clinton had put forward.and, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get congress to cooperate.obama: and ive said that im going to do things differently.', 'i think we have to open up the process.', 'everybody has to have a seat at the table.', 'and most importantly, the american people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.the point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we dont change how the politics is working in washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and were going to be four years from now debating once again how were going to bring universal health care to this country.', '(applause)brown: all right, weve got some time constraints here, so weve got to take another real quick break.', 'stay with us.', 'weve got a lot more ahead.you can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our web site, cnnpolitics.com.', 'a lot more ahead here at the university of texas.', 'well be right back.', '(commercial break)(applause)brown: an enthusiastic crowd here at the university of texas.welcome back to the texas democratic debate.', 'lets get right to it.', 'jorge ramos with the next question.ramos: senator clinton, yesterday you said, and im quoting, one of us is ready to be commander in chief.are you saying that senator obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?clinton: well, i believe that i am ready and i am prepared.', 'and i will leave that to the voters to decide.but i want to get back to health care, because i didnt get a chance to respond after senator obama finished.', 'no, let me finish, jorge...ramos: but i would like to come back...clinton: this is a significant difference.', 'you know, senator obama has said its a philosophical difference.', 'i think its a substantive difference.he has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children.', 'i agree with that.', 'i just know that if we dont go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system.', 'everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.', '(applause)and you know, in one of our earlier debates, john edwards made a great point.', 'it would be as though social security were voluntary.', 'medicare, one of the great accomplishments of president johnson, was voluntary.', '(applause)i do not believe that is going to work.', 'so its not just a philosophical difference.clinton: you look at what will work and what will not work.', 'if you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.', '(applause)brown: all right.', 'we appreciate that you want to make a point, senator obama.', 'we have limited time, so i would like jorge to move on to another subject or were going to be out of time.', '(crosstalk)obama: well, i understand.', 'but i think that senator clinton made a...(laughter)you know, shes making a point, and i think i should have the opportunity to respond very briefly.', 'and ill try to make...brown: very briefly, absolutely.obama: number one, understand that when senator clinton says a mandate, its not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, its a mandate on individuals to purchase it.', 'and senator clinton is right; we have to find out what works.obama: now, massachusetts has a mandate right now.', 'they have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent cant afford it.in some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still cant afford it, so now theyre worse off than they were.', 'they dont have health insurance and theyre paying a fine.', '(applause)in order for you to force people to get health insurance, youve got to have a very harsh penalty, and senator clinton has said that we wont go after their wages.', 'now, this is a substantive difference.', 'but understand that both of us seek to get universal health care.', 'i have a substantive difference with senator clinton on how to get there.brown: all right, senator clinton?clinton: wait a minute, no, this is too important.', 'this is the number one issue that people talk to me about.', 'you know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, i cant get the operation my son needs because i dont have health insurance, it is personal for me.clinton: and i just fundamentally disagree.you know, senator obamas plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...obama: thats right.clinton: ... insure their children.obama: thats right.clinton: because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.obama: theres a reason.clinton: hes also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.we would not have a social compact with social security and medicare if everyone did not have to participate.', 'i want a universal health care plan.', '(applause)obama: now, thats -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan.', 'point number one.point number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is weve got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.obama: there are no excuses.', 'if a parent is not providing health care for that child, its because the parents not being responsible, under my plan.', 'and those children dont have a choice.', 'but i think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.and it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.but the notion that, somehow, i am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true.brown: all right.', 'jorge...clinton: we disagree on that.brown: ok. jorge -- lets let jorge re-ask his question, because i dont think anyone remembers that one.', '(laughter)ramos: let me try again, and not in spanish, ok?', '(laughter)here we go again.', 'because we also believe the war in iraq is very important.and heres the question.', 'are you suggesting that senator obama is not ready; he doesnt have the experience to be commander in chief?', 'thats a question of: what did you mean by that phrase?clinton: what i mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, ive been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in kosovo, to stand up for womens rights as human rights around the world.', 'ive served on the senate...(applause)ive served on the senate armed services committee, and i have worked as one of the leaders in the congress on behalf of homeland security in the very difficult challenges we face.you know, just this week, its a good example.', 'we had elections in pakistan, we had change in government in cuba -- or at least the leadership.', 'weve had the elections that, you know, should have happened that havent happened and just changed the leader the way they do in cuba.', 'weve had kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in serbia.so we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities.', 'you know, we now have opportunities perhaps with cuba, i hope with president musharraf, for him to do the right thing.clinton: i supported the independence of kosovo because i think it is imperative that in the heart of europe we continue to promote independence and democracy.', 'and i would be moving very aggressively to hold the serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy.', 'under international law, they should be doing that.so when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, i believe that i am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from george bush.', 'and that is what i am putting forth to the voters.', '(applause)brown: senator obama?obama: i wouldnt be running if i didnt think i was prepared to be commander-in-chief.', '(applause)my number one job as president will be to keep the american people safe.', 'i will do whatever is required to accomplish that.', 'i will not hesitate to act against those that would do america harm.now, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations.', 'and there are an awful lot of families here in texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when i am president.', '(applause)obama: but it also means using our military wisely.', 'and on what i believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in iraq, i believe i showed the judgment of a commander in chief.', 'and i think that senator clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.', '(applause)now, that has consequences -- that has significant consequences, because it has diverted attention from afghanistan where al qaeda, that killed 3,000 americans, are stronger now than at any time since 2001.you know, ive heard from an army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon.', 'ended up being sent to afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to iraq.obama: and as a consequence, they didnt have enough ammunition, they didnt have enough humvees.', 'they were actually capturing taliban weapons, because it was easier to get taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.now, thats a consequence of bad judgment.', 'and you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, whos going to show the judgment to lead?', 'and i think that on every critical issue that weve seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into iraq originally, i didnt just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.i said this is going to distract us from afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-american sentiment; its going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military.', 'and i was right.on the question of pakistan, which senator clinton just raised -- we just had an election there.', 'but ive said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the musharraf basket.', 'that was a mistake.', 'we should be going after al qaeda and making sure that pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy.', 'and i was right about that.on the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, i have shown the judgment to lead.', 'that is the leadership that i want to show when im president of the united states.obama: on the issues that have come up, that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, i have shown the judgment to lead.', 'that is the leadership that i want to show when im president of the united states.', '(applause)brown: all right.', 'were going to stay with this and stay on iraq.john king?king: i want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made.', 'because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you dont have the experience to be commander in chief.and you have both said, its not about that type of experience; its about judgment.you both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the united states senate, about whether to support the surge.', 'and as that was going on, senator clinton, you had the commanding general in iraq before you.', 'and you said, i think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief -- your words to general petraeus.king: i want you to look at iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better.', 'ideal, no, but better -- some say significantly, in recent days, even some steps toward a political reconciliation.is iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?clinton: well, john, i think you forget a very important premise of the surge.', 'the rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.now, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.clinton: but the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled.', 'the iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasnt taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.that is why i have said, upon taking office i would ask the secretary of defense and the joint chiefs of staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that i could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.and i would begin that with...(applause)... with a very clear message to the iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by president bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.clinton: i believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin.last night in brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, please, my husbands there for the third time.', 'bring him home.and i told her privately what i have said publicly many times -- i will bring him home because i do not think it is in the interest of america or of the iraqis that we continue to be there.', 'it is up to the iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.', '(applause)brown: senator obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning.', 'were you wrong?obama: well, i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced in iraq.', 'and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.in fact, you know, the 1st cavalry, out of fort hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al qaeda out of baghdad.', '(applause)obama: and, you know, we honor their service.but this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.', '(laughter)and i think that, when were having a debate with john mccain, it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision...(applause)... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.', '(laughter)because, ultimately, thats whats at stake.', 'understand, not only have we been diverted from afghanistan.', 'weve been diverted from focusing on latin america.we contribute -- our entire foreign aid to latin america is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in iraq in a week.obama: and it is any surprise, then, that youve seen people like hugo chavez and countries like china move into the void, because weve been neglectful of that.iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded iraq, and that is something that i think john mccain has to come to terms with.so that is a debate that im happy to have.one last point i want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the american people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still dont honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still dont screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that theyre getting mental services that they need, that we are still...(applause)... having veterans in south texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.obama: thats unacceptable.', 'but we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that were spending $12 billion every month in iraq means that we cant engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive.', 'it means that we cant deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both senator clinton and i are looking for.and that is also an argument that we have to have with john mccain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years.', 'the notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink.', 'as john mccain says, he doesnt really understand the economy that well.', 'it is clear from his embrace of george bushs policies that he doesnt, and thats what i intend to change when i am president of the united states of america.', '(applause)brown: all right.', 'weve got to take another quick break.', 'weve got a lot more ahead.', 'stay with us.', 'well be right back.', '(commercial break)brown: welcome back to the texas democratic debate.stay with us after the debate.', 'anderson cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.but back to the debate.john king?king: thank you.both of you have been harshly critical of the bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.tonight, senator obama, youve talked about more transparency.', 'you also at one point criticized earmarks.and yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.and you have refused to say where the money went, what its for.', 'why?obama: no, thats not true.', 'weve actually disclosed, john, all our earmarks.', 'and so, you know, well be happy to provide you with that information, because i believe very strongly in transparency.obama: as i indicated earlier, one of the things that i did last year was to pass a bill with tom coburn, very conservative republican but a sincere fiscal conservative.', 'and we got together and created what we call google for government.', 'its a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look.', 'and if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where its going and who sponsored it.', 'and if they see a no-bid contract going to halliburton, they can check that out, too.and you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the american people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what its supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money.', 'and ive been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.obama: now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states.', 'i have actively pursued projects that i think are important.', 'but i want to make sure that theyre not done in the dark of night, that theyre not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, this is the kind of spending that i think is important.i have consistently supported those efforts.', 'i will push for those as president of the united states of america.king: senator clinton, as you know, i think your number was about $342 million.', 'you say theyre worthy projects, as senator obama did, for your state and thats part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.senator mccain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.on the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many americans frankly think, whether it is the house or the senate, that you all waste money on things that arent important to them, dont affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the american people that, i have done this my entire career; i will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?clinton: well, no, not at all.', 'because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the bush administration and the iraq war, with the billions of dollars...(applause)... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.you know, when president bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus.', 'and it is gone.', 'and we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.we borrow money from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis.', 'that is not a winning strategy for america.', '(applause)i will get us back to fiscal responsibility.', 'and i will make it clear that the bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.clinton: middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: those will be my priorities.and i think its important that we look at where the money has gone under president bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that havent saved us money and have reduced accountability.so the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and i believe that we can get back on the path we were on.', 'it was working well.', 'it was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.ive got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that ive published the last few days, because its part of what we have to do again.', 'and i think that i will be very comfortable and effective in taking on senator mccain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the republican party that hes been a part of.', '(applause)brown: all right.an issue relating to the current election.jorge?ramos: as we can see, this has been an extremely close nomination battle that will come down to superdelegates.', 'house speaker nancy pelosi, the highest ranking democrat in government, said recently, and im quoting, it would be a problem -- and this is a question for you, senator clinton -- it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided.do you agree?clinton: well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, i think that it will sort itself out.', 'im not worried about that.', 'we will have a nominee, and we will have a unified democratic party, and we will go on to victory in november.', '(applause)brown: senator obama, go ahead.', 'do you have a response to senator clinton?obama: well, i think it is important, given how hard senator clinton and i have been working, that these primaries and caucuses count for something.', 'and so my belief is that...(applause)... the will of the voters, expressed in this long election process, is what ultimately will determine who our next nominee is going to be.obama: but understand what i think is most important to the voters, and that is that we have a government that is listening to them again.', 'they feel as if theyve been shut out.you know, when i meet mothers who are trying to figure out how to get health care for their kids, its not just the desperation of that single mom.', 'its also that when they try to find some help, oftentimes theyre hitting a brick wall.and they dont get a sense that the debates that are happening in washington right now relate to them at all.', 'and what they believe is that people are trying to get on tv and theyre trying to score points and theyre trying to win elections, and that theyre not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the american people and their dreams.and i have no doubt that the democratic party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the american people.obama: and i think that the next nominee going into the november election is going to have a lot to talk about because the american people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected.', 'they want their government back, and thats what i intend to provide them when im nominated for president of the united states.', '(applause)brown: we have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question.', 'youve both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about whos ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president.a leaders judgment is most tested at times of crisis.', 'im wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most, that moment of crisis.brown: senator obama?obama: well, you know, i wouldnt point to a single moment.', 'but what i look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, i was raised by a single mom.', 'my father left when i was two, and i was raised by my mother and my grandparents.and, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when i made mistakes and was off course.', 'and what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how i can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.and so, working as a community organizer on the streets of chicago, with ordinary people, bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care, economic security to people who didnt have it, then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on wall street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience, i think, is the judgment that i now bring.obama: its the reason that i have the capacity to bring people together, and its the reason why i am determined to make sure that the american people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity.', '(applause)brown: senator clinton?clinton: well, i think everybody here knows ive lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life.', 'and...(applause)and i am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless americans.but people often ask me, how do you do it?', 'you know, how do you keep going?', 'and i just have to shake my head in wonderment, because with all of the challenges that ive had, they are nothing compared to what i see happening in the lives of americans every single day.', 'along with senator mccain, as the only two elected officials, to speak at the opening at the intrepid center at brooke medical center in san antonio, a center designed to take care of and provide rehabilitation for our brave young men and women who have been injured in war.and i remember sitting up there and watching them come in.', 'those who could walk were walking.', 'those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others.', 'some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys.', 'and the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb.clinton: you know, the hits ive taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country.and i resolved at a very young age that id been blessed and that i was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what i could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that i took for granted.thats what gets me up in the morning.', 'thats what motivates me in this campaign.', '(applause)and, you know, no matter what happens in this contest -- and i am honored, i am honored to be here with barack obama.', 'i am absolutely honored.', '(applause)clinton: whatever happens, were going to be fine.', 'you know, we have strong support from our families and our friends.', 'i just hope that well be able to say the same thing about the american people, and thats what this election should be about.', '(applause)brown: all right, a standing ovation here in austin, texas.', 'our thanks to senator barack obama and senator hillary clinton.', 'we appreciate your time tonight.', '(applause)and to john and jorge as well.we also want to thank our debate

business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the trump soho hotel and condominium project.', 'and in 2010, according to trump’s lawyer, sater was provided business cards by the trump organization identifying him as a “senior advisor to trump.sater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney.', 'but he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to trump.', 'on his website, he called the trump soho his “most prized project.” for years he identified himself on his online resume at the linkedin website as having been a senior advisor to trump in 2010-2011. last month, after abc news asked trump’s attorney about it, that portion of sater’s online resume was deleted.the “senior advisor” title stands in sharp contrast to how trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with sater, including in response to questions from abc news.alan garten, trump’s general counsel, initially told abc news that trump “had no real direct relationship with felix sater” and that sater was not an advisor to donald trump “in my mind, and not in anyone at the trump organizations mind.”a few days later, garten confirmed the authenticity of sater’s trump business card with the “senior advisor” title which included a trump organization email address and phone number.', 'but the lawyer said the title was not reflective of sater’s actual role.', 'it was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles “in order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.”cyrus mccrimmon/denver post/getty imagesgarten said sater was “never employed by or on the payroll of the trump organization” and that “no deals ever came from those activities” in 2010. but garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether sater was provided office space or compensated by the trump organization in any other way.', 'images of sater’s business card were wiped from the internet shortly after abc news asked garten about it.trump’s extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the gop presidential nomination.the cast of characters who participated in trump’s many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire.', 'trump says his “tremendous” record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become president of the united states.the connection to felix sater dates to the early 2000s when the trump organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in trump tower called the bayrock group, where sater was an executive until 2007.as trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when bayrock was a tenant in his trump tower office building, when “somebody from bayrock, im not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my children” with a proposal for a development deal.', '“it could have been felix sater, it could have been -- i really dont know who it might have been,” trump said, “but somebody from bayrock.”obtained by abc newssater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the el rio grande restaurant and bar in new york.', 'according to court documents, sater allegedly told a man at the bar, “i’ll kill you.', 'i’ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.” sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves.', 'he was convicted of first degree assault.as he began his work with bayrock, sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million “pump and dump” stock scam.', 'federal prosecutors announced in a march 2, 2000 press release that sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four new york mob families.', 'sater and others had “planned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,” the release said.prosecutors said sater and others had “enlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of la cosa nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.”sater avoided prison after fbi agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation.', 'his lawyer, robert wolf, told the associated press that some of the information about sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory.', 'wolf told the ap that credits saters stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving american military lives, although he did not provide details.', 'wolf told the ap to write about saters past at your own risk but did not cite specific concerns.during this period, sater’s role at bayrock was not clearly defined.', 'he at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the “chief operating officer” or “managing director.” in a 2010 deposition sater said titles at the firm varied.', '“i was probably number two man in the company,” he said.', '“the actual position, i dont remember what it was.”while the trump soho project was considered a success, four other bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others.', 'some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors.', 'in each case, trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects.during this period, trump and bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot trump international hotel and residences, phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, “exquisite gardens,” and “a world-class celebrity chef restaurant.”the project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against “the trump/bayrock organization,” the plaintiff alleged that sater threatened one of the arizona partners in the deal, a man named earnest mennes.', 'sater was alleged to have told mennes he would call in a relative to “electrically shock mr. mennes testicles, cut off mr. mennes legs, and leave mr. mennes dead in the trunk of his car.”sater’s lawyer calls the allegation “an outright fabrication” made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement.reached in arizona, mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it.', 'mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the trump project, and considers trump a masterful businessman.', 'trump’s lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the arizona lawsuit.trump’s attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with sater on the various joint ventures with bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background.“to be clear,” garten told abc news, “mr.', 'saters involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, soho and fort lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.”saters alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in december 2007 when the new york times published an article featuring sater’s ties to trump and describing his “tangled past.” the article reported that sater “had been an ‘unindicted co-conspirator’ and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four mafia families.”sater told the times that activity was in the past.', '“i’m trying to lead an exemplary existence,” he said then.', '“old, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.”while sater’s criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because sater had become a “cooperator” on a range of matters.sater’s attorney provided abc news with a copy of a public statement from attorney general loretta lynch, whose new york office had enlisted cooperation from sater when she was serving as a u.s. attorney.“the defendant in question, felix sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,” her statement said.', 'he provided information “crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of la cosa nostra.”garten said trump read the 2007 times report and was “surprised.”“he had no idea,” garten said.', 'it “was the first time that both the trump organization and bayrock learned of mr. saters background.”garten added, “when you go into business with another company, youre going to vet that company certainly, but youre not going to vet every employee, it’s just not appropriate.once that information became publicly known, garten initially told abc news, trump “cut all ties” with sater.', 'but, garten then acknowledged, the trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by sater well after that.asked why trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, garten told abc news, “you’re going to look at the deal, you’re not going to look at the broker.”during his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about sater’s past, trump said he knew sater had “got into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.” and, he added, “i don’t know him very well, but i don’t think he was connected to the mafia.”in 2013, the bbc pressed trump asking why he didn’t say “you’re fired!” to sater after reports surfaced alleging sater had ties to organized crime, trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview.“i hate to do this, but i do have that big group of people waiting so i have to leave,” he said, walking out of the room.trump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the bbc interview.in august, the washington examiner asked trumps campaign manager, corey lewandowski, about the mogul’s past dealings with sater.', 'i have no idea who felix sater is, he has nothing to do with the donald j. trump for president presidential campaign, lewandowski replied.', 'ive never heard of the guy.”for investors who put money into those trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing.cathy cather, a fort lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the trump condominium hotel project in her hometown – which failed in part because of the economic collapse.', 'she told abc news she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with trump’s photos and such slogans as there is luxury... and then there is the trump experience.“i invested because it was trump,” cather told abc news.abc news randy kreider and alex hosenball contributed to this report.']","['mikebates brianross i wish i could say

only be an option for those who dont have insurance.', 'no one would be forced to choose it, and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance.', 'in fact, based on congressional budget

health care.second, weve estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system – a system that is currently full of waste and abuse.', 'right now, too much of the hard-earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care doesnt make us healthier.', 'thats not my judgment – its the judgment of medical professionals across this country.', 'and this is also true when it comes to medicare and medicaid.in fact, i want to speak directly to americas seniors for a moment, because medicare is another issue thats been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate.more than four decades ago, this nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work, our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years.', 'that is how medicare was born.', 'and it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next.', 'that is why not a dollar of the medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan.the only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud, as well as unwarranted subsidies in medicare that go to insurance companies – subsidies that do everything to pad their profits and nothing to improve your care.', 'and we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead.these steps will ensure that you – americas seniors – get the benefits youve been promised.', 'they will ensure that medicare is there for future generations.', 'and we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pocket for prescription drugs.', 'thats what this plan will do for you.', 'so dont pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut – especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against medicare in the past, and just this year supported a budget that would have essentially turned medicare into a privatized voucher program.', 'that will never happen on my watch.', 'i will protect medicare.now, because medicare is such a big part of the health care system, making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody.', 'we have long known that some places, like the intermountain healthcare in utah or the geisinger health system in rural pennsylvania, offer high-quality care at

experts.', 'and according to these same experts, this modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of us in the long-run.finally, many in this chamber – particularly on the republican side of the aisle – have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of health care.', 'i dont believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet, but i have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs.', 'so i am proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine.', 'i know that the bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual states to test these issues.', 'its a good idea, and i am directing my secretary of health and human services to move forward on this initiative today.add it all up, and the plan im proposing will cost around $900 billion over ten years – less than we have spent on the iraq and afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few americans that congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration.', 'most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent – but spent badly – in the existing health care system.', 'the plan will not add to our deficit.', 'the middle-class will realize greater security, not higher taxes.', 'and if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one-tenth of one percent each year, it will actually reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.this is the plan im proposing.', 'its a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight – democrats and republicans.', 'and i will continue to seek common ground in the weeks

charleston, s.c., on jan. 14, 2016, trump also took a shot at china over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, north korea.trump said, china, they dont like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of north korea.', 'they can solve the problem of north korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.with the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether trump was right that china has total control, just about, of north korea.when we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer.', 'china, they said, does have notable influence over north korea because it provides or enables transit for much of north korea’s supply of goods from the outside world.', 'but that influence, they added, falls well short of total control.china does not ‘control’ north korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over north korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than beijing is willing to acknowledge, said evans j.r. revere, a senior fellow at the brookings institution’s center for east asia policy studies.robert ross, a china expert at boston college and harvard university, compared the relationship between china and north korea to that between a parent and a teenager.it’s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent, ross said.', 'do the parents have total control?', 'perhaps – they provide food and shelter.', 'but the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive – driving a child out of the house and away from the family.', 'china has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with north korea.', 'but is there total control?', 'that is debatable.china’s leverage over north koreathe strongest argument for china having significant control over north korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.north korea has a lengthy land border with china -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while north korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from north korea’s perspective to move goods over land.', 'research by stephan haggard of the university of california-san diego and marcus noland of the peterson institute for international economics estimates that china may account for as much as 80 percent of north korea’s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.north korea would face daunting economic problems if china were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so, haggard told politifact.why ‘total control’ is an exaggerationyet while china’s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn’t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing trump’s quote.', '(the trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.', ')for starters, china has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current north korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.china is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees, haggard said.it also has become painfully obvious over the years that north korea doesn’t exactly listen to outsiders.mr.', 'trump is correct that the chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the north korean regime resisting them with everything they had, said joseph de thomas, a professor of international affairs at penn state university.', 'this is hardly control.not only has north korea thumbed its nose at the united nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world.', 'in fact, the country’s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.north korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no ones lead, revere said.', 'this has been a consistent element of north korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the united states, for south korea, the east asia region, and the international community at large.indeed, despite north korea’s heavy reliance on china for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, it is not clear that the leadership cares, said ross of boston college and harvard.', 'for decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.meanwhile, north korea’s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from china -- which only further complicates china’s situation.this was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.china publicly and privately exhorted north korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail, said scott a. snyder, director of the program on u.s.-korea policy at the council on foreign relations.', 'as a result, relations between china and north korea are strained.', 'chinese president xi has not met with north korea’s kim jong-un, while meeting six times with the south korean leader.that does not sound like a country in total control of another.trump’s claim suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both china and north korea, both today and over the decades, revere said.', 'it is virtually certain that the chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test.', 'in the view of virtually every north korea and china expert i know, the nuclear test was a slap in chinas face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.our rulingtrump said china has total control, just about, of north korea.he has a point that china holds significant leverage over north korea if it wishes to exercise it, since china provides the vast majority of north korea’s international trade, including food and fuel imports.', 'but trump’s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the north korean government’s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer.', 'the fact that north korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of china suggests that beijing lacks anything approaching
