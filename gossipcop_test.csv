many more people was that a—hole gonna get killed?” cudlitz said, according to comicbook.com.', 'and while the audience was apparently shocked by this statement, hes not wrong.', 'rick led his people

streaming and video charts and its stunningly-brutal critical reception were perhaps only eclipsed in the pop culture blogosphere this weekend by the season finale of game of thrones, an event every bit as anticipated and monoculturally-in tune as a tswift music video.', 'with the two overlapping in such a profound way, it got this author thinking; maybe there is more in common between a song of ice and fire and a song interpolating right said fred’s “i’m too sexy” than we once thought.', 'maybe, just maybe, this happenstance of scheduling has allowed us to see with a clearer eye what taylor swift is up to with her latest album cycle: namely, that she has now become the cersei lannister of pop music.', 'pascal le segretain / getty images  and while it may seem unfair to compare swift to a monarch who murdered hundreds of innocent people by detonating a cache of explosives under a cathedral, the pop star’s current reinvention in support of her upcoming album reputation carries many of

privilege than we are capable of imagining.', 'the lead-up to taylor unveiling her latest radio-juggernaut was one that played on the now-widespread public opinion of the pop star being a ‘snake.’ while there are numerous plot points in that story (for a detailed overview, head here), the most integral is the moment last year when she was outed as a liar by kim kardashian west.', 'the world saw for themselves that the taylor swift pr-factory had completely fabricated the notion that kanye west acted without her knowledge or consent when honoring her with the lyrical compliment that they “might still have sex.” the catastrophic blow to her clean-cut image led swift to decamp out of the public eye for the better part of a year, only emerging now with “look what you made me do,” a long-overdue – and some would argue, unnecessary – response.', 'cersei found herself in a very similar pr disaster during game of thrones‘ fifth season.', 'after cultivating an image of being a woman of high moral character worthy of a seat on the king’s small council, she had this narrative irrevocably destroyed by the high sparrow (the westerosi-equivalent of the pope) who promptly had her

sins.', 'in taylor’s case this naked march was metaphorical, yet the sentiment remains much the same.', 'now, returned to positions of power after well-earned respites to lick their wounds, both women are employing a simple, one-point strategy: enact violent revenge on all those that have wronged them, regardless of any and all other factors.', 'for cersei, this meant that aforementioned cathedral explosion in order to cast aside her enemies and seize limitless power.', 'for taylor, it meant “look what you made me do,” a heavy-handed earworm written in order to cast aside her previous public perceptions and seize limitless pop music power.', 'the key to the psychology of both of these women at this new stage of their career is that they are performing a balancing act.', 'taylor and cersei have demonstrably proven they are at the peak of their powers.', 'they tell us with frequent, repetitive kiss-offs to their enemies, and they show us with their newfound affinity for black clothing and garments with pointed shoulders.', 'but this heightened ‘do not fuck with me’ power lies in us accepting two, at-times conflicting narratives – that they are both victim and merciless badass.',

good works but from being victimized by their detractors.', 'detractors who, for the record, were not necessarily wrong in their attempts to bring these women down a peg.', 'would we not have wanted

brazenly about the incident.', 'arya has a good reason to resent sansa for her awful behavior, and to bring it up among her other accusations against sansa.', 'in the first novel, sansa performed an act that perhaps could be considered as a betrayal against her house - of her own free will, without any coercion: her father told her he intended to send her and arya back to winterfell; sansa could not bear the thought of being sent away from her beloved joffrey, so she told that to cersei.', 'in the second novel, cersei claimed that neds plan was foiled thanks to sansas warning.', 'actually,

watching their fathers execution, in season 1s baelor, as she was hiding in the crowd in front of the great sept. it seems bizarre that arya accuses sansa of being there willingly given that sansa broke into screaming when joffrey declared he would kill ned, and then outright fainted when he was beheaded.', 'however, arya – who wasnt even a teenager yet – didnt actually see sansa faint: yoren was holding her tight and she had already abandoned the vantage point that let her see above the crowd.', 'when sansa accused arya of inaction when their father was condemned to death, arya doesnt mention how she jumped down from the base of baelors statue and fought through the crowd, trying to get to her father, and was only restrained by yoren who, at ned starks bidding, rushed over to protect her, shield her eyes from his execution, and get her out of kings landing.', 'arya recalls their father eddard stark watching from the catwalk while the boys practiced archery in the courtyard, then she practiced when the boys left but had to try many times to hit the target.', 'while this is similar to the stark familys first scene in the season 1 premiere winter is coming, it must be describing something that happened earlier: in that episode, arya fired one arrow and hit the target, while her parents and the boys were still there.', 'arya says that sansa didnt really watch the archery practice sessions because she was at the sewing circle with septa mordane, whom joffrey executed along with the rest of neds household servants in kings landing at the end of season 1. in the season 1 premiere, arya snuck away from the sewing circle with sansa and mordane to watch the archery practice.', 'in the novels, arya actually isnt skilled at archery; in fact, she has not shot even one arrow in the novels.', 'fans have pointed out that her scene in season 1 scoring a bulls eye on her target when bran failed to contradicted this, as she isnt a preternaturally skilled archer with no training.', 'this episode retroactively explains that she was simply practicing in secret for some time before that.', 'one of the faces arya has created as magic faceless men shapeshifter masks is clearly the face of walder frey.', 'it is unknown who the other faces are from.', 'the inside the episode video points out an additional reason for sansas shock when arya starts speaking behind her, after she discovers her bag of faces: notice the camera clearly showed sansa closing the only door into the room, but when the camera pulls back to reveal arya, the door is still

somewhat unclear, as is lyanna mormonts age.', 'she was stated to be 10 years old in season 5, but then described as 10 years old again in season 6, even though other story elements seem to indicate that around a year passed between those seasons – its possible that they were rounding, or that this was simply a dialogue error (repeating the line about her age without the tv writers taking the passage of time into account).', 'lyanna should have been 11 years old in season 6, and at most 12 years old in season 7 (assuming that one year passes each season, a pattern which generally held in prior seasons – but for all we know season 7 might simply break with this and happen in a shorter timeframe).', 'the matter is moot, however, because sansa was stated in dialogue to be 13 years old in season 1 – so whichever scenario, lyanna is at most 12 years old now, and thus still younger than sansa was.', 'also regarding the passage of time, sansa makes the only comment ever to address this in season 7 itself, but only by vaguely saying that it has been weeks since jon left winterfell for dragonstone.', 'given that months are composed of weeks, this could refer to anything from four weeks to four months – the tv writers may have been deliberately ambiguous about this.', 'sansa says that theyre asking 20,000 men to fight for them.', 'this doesnt seem to match prior numbers and is likely a hyperbolic remark or miscalculation on sansas part: earlier this season, jon said there were fewer than 10,000 soldiers left in the north – though he was possibly referring to just the soldiers raised in the north itself, and not the large army from the vale that came to winterfell.', 'given that the vale stayed neutral for most of the war of the five kings, until heading to winterfell to help defeat the boltons, it should have a full strength army in the range of 20-30,000 men (i.e.', 'robb could raise 20,000 men from the north in season 1 when their armies were fresh, tywin could raise even more in the south, etc.).', 'arya suggests sansa to play the game of faces - the game she used to play with the waif (unbowed, unbent, unbroken).', 'the wight hunt - jons group heading

the night king were to be killed, all the white walkers he turned, and all subsequent wights, would be killed, effectively annihilating the entire horde of the undead with a single blow.', 'this hasnt been revealed yet in the novels – if it is even true in the novels – and may in fact be a massive, tv-first revelation.', 'the showrunners stated in the inside the episode video for the preceding episode that the wight hunt is an idea we came up with – in a context that almost assuredly means it wont actually happen in the next novel, but is an invention of the tv series.', 'similarly, in the

happen too fast for the audience to experience as he does, etc.).', 'the entire battle scene, from when the wights start crossing the frozen lake to when jon is saved by benjen, lasts a full 9 minutes

alexander mcqueen—two of the most theatrical, outré designers imaginable—but there is nothing even remotely edgy about what she does.', 'she is unapologetically romantic, clinging to a decidedly unfeminist ideal that there is no happier moment in a woman’s life than when she finally finds that perfect dress.', 'as one fashion insider puts it, “georgina puts pretty girls in pretty dresses—and there’s value in that.” and chapman has no illusions of being avant-garde.', 'she describes marchesa dresses as “keepsakes,” to be worn “lots of times” and then hopefully handed down to a daughter.', '“we’re not doing disposable fashion,” she says.', '“we treat each dress like a piece of jewelry, an entity unto itself, with its own journey.', 'it’s not just one in a queue.”  that being said, they do have bestsellers and perennial favorites.', 'i ask chapman about price-point sweet spots.', '“it really depends,” she says.', '“one of the gowns we did last season was nearly $13,000, and we couldn’t stop selling it.', 'and then there’s an evening gown we make a version of every year that sells for around $4,995.” chapman runs down the hall, grabs one, and dangles it in front of me.', '“it’s quite sexy.', 'you’ve got a corset, it’s off the shoulder, you get some drama around the neck with these feathers, it nips you at the waist, gives you a bosom, and you get a bit of leg!', 'when you get it out, you know you’re going to feel good in that dress.”  the formula has worked for them.', 'as recently as 2016, actresses wore marchesa more often than any other designer on the red carpet.', 'as christy rilling, who fitted michelle obama into nearly every dress she wore as first lady, says, “their atelier is really special.', 'and they’ve gotten better over the years.', 'i’ve seen what they do for the oscars—they really make magic happen.”  one of the criticisms that has been leveled at marchesa is that they’d have been nothing without harvey weinstein, who, people have claimed, bullied stars into wearing his wife’s dresses.', '“they absolutely had a push from harvey,” says chapman’s friend the writer neil gaiman.', '“but you cannot hype something from nothing and make it last.', 'and harvey’s hyping worked because george is actually an artist.', 'i’ve watched her at work and been impressed and fascinated.', 'she has a vision, and she’s really good at it.”  one morning in early april, chapman texts me a photograph of a young girl in a very grown-up dress: it’s gray, with a wide skirt made of tulle and a silk corset, all of it covered with pink flowers.', '“just found this picture of a dress i made when i was eleven!', 'things haven’t changed that much!!', '!”  chapman was born and raised in richmond, an affluent suburb on the thames about eight miles from central london.', 'her father, brian chapman, was the founder of percol, the first ground-coffee company on the shelves to bear the fairtrade mark.', 'her mother, caroline wonfor, was a journalist who worked for reader’s digest for many years.', 'she has a younger brother, edward, who is the ceo of marchesa, and even though their parents divorced when she was in her 20s, they are a very close-knit group.', '“my father is self-made,” says chapman.', '“he came from a council estate, left school at sixteen, and he built his own company with an incredible work ethic.', 'he’s a true entrepreneur, and he’s always been deeply involved with philanthropy, a forward-thinker that way.”  she admits she had a very awkward childhood.', 'she was born with a hip defect, “which meant that i had terrible pigeon toes, so i couldn’t walk to the top of the street without falling over.', 'i was incredibly clumsy, and it set me back at school socially.', 'i was always that kid who was the last to be picked for any sport because i literally couldn’t do it.” she was also severely dyslexic, which went undiagnosed until she was eight.', '“i remember going to the library and everyone else could read and i couldn’t.', 'i had terrible anxiety.', 'in class when they would go around and everyone had to read .', '.', '.', 'it was just torture.”  some unholy combination of going to the victoria and albert museum costume department at seven, seeing princess diana’s wedding on tv that same year, and being deeply envious of her catholic cousins “going through all of their ceremonies in these beautiful white dresses” planted the seeds for her future.', 'when chapman was at boarding school—saint david’s in ashford, surrey—she took up drawing and painting.', 'her roommate there was andrea remanda, now a songwriter living in los angeles.', '“her side of the room looked like a bomb exploded,” remanda says.', '“she had a guns n’ roses poster, and i was into prince.', 'when we were in prep—forced homework time after school—she would draw sketches of what we did during the day, and they were amazing.', 'i still have them.”  remanda spent a lot of time at chapman’s parents’ house on weekends.', '“when we were sixteen we went clubbing one night, and she had bought a secondhand man’s blazer from oxfam for 25 pence.', 'she got out her sewing machine—i don’t even know how she found it in her crazy messy bedroom—and she did a few stitches and put it on, and i just couldn’t believe it!', 'it’s my favorite outfit she’s ever worn.', 'everyone was like, where did you get your dress?', 'it looked like a vivienne westwood.”  chapman was scouted by an agent when she was seventeen and modeled for a few years, but as she puts it, “it was very much to make ends meet.', 'i had three jobs: i worked in a bar, i was working in a ski shop on saturdays—a job i took because i could drink coffee and smoke cigarettes—and i was also waitressing.', 'and i was a terrible waitress.', 'i was so forgetful, i was clumsy, just the worst waitress ever.” remanda tells me that chapman did not love modeling.', '“being scrutinized as you are in that industry—‘too short for the catwalk!’ ‘you’ve got to lose weight!’—i don’t think she really wanted to be a part of all that.”  she was interested in acting, though, and when chapman was eighteen, she took a train to hull in northern england to check out the drama-studies department at a college there.', 'the train broke down for three hours, and while she waited she got talking to another young, aspiring actor who was heading the same way for the same reason.', 'it turned out to be oyelowo, who would go on to play martin luther king jr. in selma.', '“well, anyone who has seen georgina, the first thing that hits you like a ton of bricks is how beautiful she is, and i’d be lying if i said i didn’t notice that,” he recalls.', '“but as we talked, i found her to be an interesting and deeply friendly person.', 'she had none of that frostiness that could be associated with a model.”  neither one of them wound up going to the drama school in hull, but they’ve stayed friends.', '“i was part of a youth theater group at the national theatre in london,” oyelowo recalls, “and i invited george along to be part of it.', 'she’s a wonderful actress.', 'i remember clearly thinking that she had a very real career ahead of her had she wanted it.” a couple of years later, chapman invited oyelowo to an art exhibition at her college.', '“a lot of the drawings were of fashion, and her work really stood out,” he says.', '“i was blown away.” so much so that oyelowo asked chapman to make the costumes for the love of the nightingale, a play he was performing at the edinburgh festival.', '“and these costumes arrived, made from transparent material into which she’d sewn pieces of mirror to reflect the light.', 'they were extraordinary.', 'they upstaged everything else.”  one friday afternoon in late march, i head back to chapman’s town house for another interview over lunch, this one served by her daughter, india, playing waitress.', 'chapman’s mother, an elegant woman with silver hair in a shag cut, is visiting from london: she comes often these days and spends long stretches, helping out with india and dash.', '“she’s such a happy-go-lucky person,” says chapman, “so she always lifts the mood and the spirits.”  when the one-two punch of all of the allegations against weinstein landed in early october—first the new york times investigation, followed by the much more damning piece in the new yorker a few days later—chapman was in a kind of stupor.', '“i lost ten pounds in five days.', 'i couldn’t keep food down.” i ask her how long it took for her to absorb the information.', '“about two days,” she says.', '“my head was spinning.', 'and it was difficult because the first article was about a time long before i’d ever met him, so there was a minute where i couldn’t make an informed decision.', 'and then the stories expanded and i realized that this wasn’t an isolated incident.', 'and i knew that i needed to step away and take the kids out of here.”  she fled to los angeles with the children, while her partner, craig, did her best to steady the ship.', '“our friendship always comes first, so foremost, i was worried for georgina,” craig says.', '“secondly, we have so many talented, loyal people who work for us, some who’ve been here for twelve, thirteen years, so my concern was to get to the office and get the collections out, so that people could be paid and pay their rents.”  chapman eventually went to london to be with her parents, but first she took refuge with an old friend.', '“i kind of found myself in a first-responder capacity,” says oyelowo.', '“my wife and i were right there with her two kids, and this catastrophe was unfolding in real time across the globe, literally your worst nightmare in terms of a marriage, in terms of the future of your kids and your business.', 'and none of this was your own doing and yet you are entirely lumped into it.', 'the thing that was the most difficult to witness was that she quite rightly took the stance of not going out there and defending herself, because there was just too much white noise and too much bile headed in her general direction.', 'she felt, how dare i raise my head and say, ‘oh, by the way, i’m suffering too?’ ”  because of the scale of weinstein’s abuse and manipulations—and the lengths he allegedly went to to cover them up—there is a widely held assumption of complicity on chapman’s part.', '“she must have known” is what so many people say at dinner parties.', '“the thing that pains me,” says her friend the model and singer karen elson, “is that when anyone finds out that i know george, that’s the first thing they say.', 'like she is somehow responsible for his hideous behavior.', 'when i say, ‘well, actually she didn’t know,’ it becomes this other judgment: ‘how could she not have known?’ or: ‘well, that’s on her if she didn’t.’ it’s so complicated.”  it’s complicated, but it is also the oldest story in the book.', 'even chapman points out that—putting aside the enormity of her situation—women are betrayed by their husbands every day because they turn out to be not the men their wives thought they were.', '“i don’t want to be viewed as a victim,” she says, “because i don’t think i am.', 'i am a woman in a shit situation, but it’s not unique.”  chapman first met weinstein socially, at a party, and they began dating on and off.', '“i was living in england, and i had just come out of a relationship, so it was very slow.” was it a good marriage?', '“that’s what makes this so incredibly painful: i had what i thought was a very happy marriage.', 'i loved my life.” asked if she was ever suspicious about his behavior, she says, “absolutely not.', 'never.” for one thing, he traveled constantly.', '“and i’ve never been one of those people who obsesses about where someone is.”  it’s very difficult now for people to imagine that there was ever anything good about harvey weinstein.', 'but the fact remains that before all of the horrifying revelations, most people thought weinstein could be an asshole and a bully, but they didn’t think he was a monster.', 'there is always that beauty-and-the-beast mystery: what does she see in him?', 'when i ask chapman what the initial attraction was, she says, “well, he’s a wonderful father to my kids.', 'but initially?', 'he’s charismatic.', 'he’s an incredibly bright, very learned man.', 'and very charitable.', 'he paid for a friend of mine’s mother, who had breast cancer, to go to a top doctor.', 'he was amazing like that.', 'he is amazing like that.', 'that is the tough part of this .', '.', '.', 'this black-and-white thing .', '.', '.', 'life isn’t like that.” when i tell her that a friend of the couple’s told me that weinstein gave chapman confidence, she says, “yes.', 'absolutely.', 'he was a wonderful partner to me.', 'he was a friend and a confidant and a supporter.', 'yes, he’s a big personality.', '.', '.', '.', 'and .', '.', '.', 'but .', '.', '.', 'i don’t know.', 'i wish i had the answers.', 'but i don’t.”  when i ask the people who have known chapman the longest what they thought of her marriage, the common thread is how surprised they were by it—but for very different reasons.', '“i first met him at a polo match,” says remanda, “and i had no idea who he was.', 'i know george very well, and she’d had, like, two boyfriends before harvey.', 'so my initial reaction was, whoa.', 'he’s older, he’s brash, he’s american.', 'who is he?', 'we sat down and i think we laughed, belly-laughed, falling off our chairs, for two hours.', 'i thought, she’s going to marry this guy.”  oyelowo also vividly remembers the day he met harvey.', '“i was in my car on mulholland drive, and i got a call from george.', 'she said, ‘come to shutters on the beach; i want you to meet my new boyfriend.’ george was there, and the very famous producer harvey weinstein was there, and i was still waiting for the boyfriend to emerge until it sort of became evident: oh, this is who she meant!', 'and i will be 100 percent honest with you: i was very skeptical.', 'but as time went on, as they got married, had children, there was no way of denying that this was a genuine couple.’”  last summer chapman got to know huma abedin, a few months before the news of the allegations about weinstein broke, during play dates between their sons.', 'now they are supertight.', '“we just .', '.', '.', 'bonded,” abedin says and lets out a dark laugh.', '“in allll kinds of ways.', 'this particular club, ironically, it’s not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like georgina and me.', 'people don’t feel sorry for us; you don’t get that empathy.', 'people think you’re beautiful, you’re thin, you’re rich, you’re photographed on the red carpet, and you get stuck in this category.', 'there’s so much more depth beyond all that with georgina.”  over the summer, abedin came to see that depth.', '“you look at her from the outside, if you don’t know her, and you think, she’s perfect,” says abedin.', '“she could be a model for the clothes she designs.', 'but when you go to the house, she opens the door without any makeup on, and she’s stunning, and she’s funny and goofy with her children—who are clearly the most important people in her life.', 'she’s at the stove making chicken fingers and french fries, and she’s one of the realest people i know.', 'there’s nothing entitled about her.', 'you believe she is someone who works really hard at being a good and present mom, and doing her job really well.”  a friend of chapman’s told me that, because of the divorce, money, the kids, georgina is in regular contact with harvey.', 'i ask her, “is there anything you can say about his state of mind?” “well,” she replies with a roll of the eyes, “not really.', 'clearly when i was married to him i didn’t know anything about his state of mind, so i’m probably not the best person to ask.”  chapman’s close circle is rallying around her and hoping she will have a fresh start.', '“what i want for georgina,” says elson, “and it’s going to take time, and it’s impossible to come out unscathed, but let this be a moment in her life where she realizes that this is what made her.', 'this is what made her a woman.” when i ask chapman if there’s anything she can say about her finances, now much changed, and her future, she replies, “i’m just living moment to moment.', 'is it difficult?', 'of course.', 'but one adjusts.', 'is it going to be for the worse?', 'maybe not.”  on the day i visited her office, i noticed that chapman kept checking her phone, like she was waiting for news.', 'turns out, she was: she had put a bid on a house in upstate new york—a farm—and was hoping to find out if the bid was accepted.', '“fingers crossed,” she said.', 'with the sale of all the family homes—in the hamptons, connecticut, and the west village—chapman is trying to get herself and the children situated.', '“as soon as this happened, i had this crazy vision: i know what i need to do.', 'i need to move to a farm upstate.', 'my daughter loves riding; my son responds to animals.', 'i need to build a farm.”  indeed, when the kids came in after school.', 'dash was carrying an enormous stuffed giraffe, and india was galloping in like a horse.', '“she’s obsessed,” says chapman.', '“and when she’s not with a horse she’s pretending to be a horse.', 'i’ve had to look at my life, and maybe i’m going to create something better for my children out of this.” the farm, she says, is “rambling, it’s magical, it’s private, down a long driveway.', 'and it’s connected to horse trails, so you can just ride off of the property.', 'i promised the kids donkeys and goats.”  chapman finds out that i live in woodstock, new york, and brings up neil gaiman, who also has a house there.', 'they met when she hired him to write the screenplay for a ten-minute short she directed in 2013; gaiman had collaborated with weinstein on hayao miyazaki’s princess mononoke.', '“neil still possesses that magical quality of having a child’s imagination,” she says.', '“when you see the way that he works and the way that he thinks, it just reminds me of how one thought when one was younger—that sense of endless possibility, just pure .', '.', '.', 'untrapped creativity.” the word untrapped hung in the air.', 'unlike other friends of chapman’s, gaiman did actually worry about her being married to weinstein.', '“one reason is that i watched the person he tried to be when he was around her—which was sort of, at least to some degree, uxorious—which was not the person that he tried to be the rest of the time.', 'but i never felt that there was anything going on other than that georgina was actually in love with him.', 'there’s that point where harvey stops being a person and becomes a cultural phenomenon, though it is worth reminding people that there are human beings here.', 'and that one of those human beings could be affable and charming if he wished to be and also bullying and deceitful.', 'and he was obviously very good at this.” he pauses for a long while and says, finally, “she’s a good person who married a bad person.', 'or, if you want to be less judgmental, she’s a good person who married a person who did some terrible things.', 'and who now has to make a go of it on her own.',

more than your look.', 'here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business.', '1. you don’t have a great blow-dryer.', 'let’s start at the very beginning: investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often.', '“if you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” kérastase celebrity stylist jennifer yepez tells self.', 'expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology.', 'the last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time.', '“the technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds.', 'the less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be.', 'yepez’s favorites are the new t3 cura luxe ($250) and the dyson supersonic ($399).', 'expensive?', 'yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years.', '2. you’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel.', '“after getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says giovanni vaccaro, glasmsquad’s creative director.', '“a cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and its more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains.', 'if you want to get rid of excess water, vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the aquis or an old, clean t-shirt.', 'and still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo.', 'the best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying.', '“hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains vaccaro.', 'make sure to dry your hair according to your texture.', 'vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying.', 'that’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp.', 'if you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt.', 'once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying.', '3. you start in with the brush too soon.', 'on the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair.', 'it’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout.', 't3 celebrity stylist david lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first.', 'set it to medium heat and low speed.', '“if hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says.', '“this can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding

charles that was acutely bitter.', 'there had been the sensation of her appearance on the bbc in the now legendary television interview with martin bashir, where she revealed to a shocked nation the

bachelor” arie luyendyk jr. proposed to becca kufrin and the couple was engaged.', 'however, over the next two months, after the season had wrapped, luyendyk had a change of heart and realized he made the wrong choice and was actually in love with runner-up lauren burnham, so he broke up with kufrin — and the entire thing was caught on film.', 'abc’s cameras followed luyendyk as he broke off his engagement to kufrin, and the network aired the scene completely unedited, showing exactly what happened between the pair during the difficult conversation.', 'the following night on “after the final rose,” kufrin was named abc’s next leading lady who will star in “the bachelorette,” and her journey to find love again began last night on “after the final rose.”  related ‘the bachelor’ arie luyendyk jr. teases plenty of drama in finale most memorable reality tv moments of 2018  meanwhile, luyendyk sat down with burnham on “after the final rose,” as the glowing couple told america about their rekindled relationship over the past two months, and then luyendyk proposed to burnham.', 'the two are now engaged, and have embarked on a mini media tour, sitting down with jimmy kimmel, and making appearances today on abc’s “good morning america” and “live with kelly and ryan.”  the dramatic two-part finale has garnered overwhelming support for kufrin, but has caused a social media outcry in response to luyendyk’s behavior.', 'here, abc’s executive in charge of “the bachelor” franchise, robert mills, senior vp of alternative series, specials, and late-night programming, talks to variety about filming the breakup and choosing to air the footage completely unedited — plus, what he thinks about kufrin as the next “bachelorette.”  looking back on the entire season, what do you think overall?', 'i liked this season.', 'i think it’s pretty clear we made a conscious decision to do a more straightforward season of “the bachelor,” and i liked that because at the end of the day, we really believe in this concept and really want it to be about finding love and making connections.', 'i’m really proud of it, creatively.', 'i’m not blind that the ratings are down, so that’s a bit of a disappointment, and i wish that the audience had liked this season a little better.', 'we’ve seen some negativity both toward arie and the some of the people in this season and the show in general, so every season when the show ends, me and the producers take a look at what worked and what didn’t and we will work to make a phenomenal season of “the bachelorette.”  what went into the decision to film arie and becca after the proposal?', 'you had never done that before.', 'it lends credence to the fact that “the bachelor” is not just over the top because one of the problems [with the show] is that you’re dating people in a way that you never would in real life, and then you have to start a life with this person, and so in the finale, you actually see what happens in the real world.', 'it’s incredibly relatable and it’s a place we’ve all been.', 'the stuff you see here is stuff that we’ve all done and we’ve all been through.', 'there’s heartbreak and there is hope, but it is riveting and it’s why we watch “the bachelor” because when good or bad things happen, we all want to relate that these things happen to other people.', 'when the show really does that, it’s when it’s at it’s best.', 'what was your reaction when arie started having second thoughts, and wanted to break up with becca to get back together with lauren?', 'you go to the place where you say this will be great, riveting tv, but you’ve got to realize that these are real people — not just becca, but arie and lauren — and this could happen to anyone, so i think that makes it really difficult.', 'part of the importance of doing this on camera is it’s sort of a contract with the audience that you’re going to see the whole relationship from beginning to end on tv, and you’re taking that journey with them, and it’s important to understand the whole thing because now there will be no doubt in anyone’s mind what the reason is [that arie and becca broke up].', 'people can feel how they want to after seeing it, as opposed to just hearing about it.', 'you have never shown footage of a couple after the proposal, and in this case, you filmed for an additional two months.', 'in future seasons, will you be continuing to film couples after the proposal?', 'the things we’ve learned with “the bachelor” is that it has to constantly evolve.', 'like you see with the fantasy suite, now you see the morning after, and that’s really important because it’s a totally different phase of the relationship and those conversations inform how all of the decisions are going to be made.', 'so this change is the same thing, and i think you’ll start to see more of this now, as we keep evolving the show.', 'was it just a coincidence that the first time you decided to continue to film after the proposal, that this bombshell breakup happened?', 'it wasn’t purposeful.', 'a lot of the stuff was shot on iphones and it’s just stuff that we had of them being together and being kind of goofy together.', 'it was interesting watching it and getting to see how these people are in real life, so i am glad it gave us a reason to use that [iphone footage], and i think we’ll look at how we can implement that more in seasons going forward.', 'but it wasn’t like, “oh my god, thank god we had this footage.” it just worked itself in organically into the fabric of the finale.', 'can you clear up the timeline of the proposal and the breakup, and lauren starting to date arie?', 'the proposal happened right before thanksgiving and then the breakup happened in january, so it was almost two months in between, and that’s when arie asked lauren for a second chance, just so they can date.', 'and that was two months ago, and things are going incredibly well.', 'how long after the breakup did abc ask becca to be “the bachelorette?”  you have to be respectful.', 'you can’t say, “you just had your heart broken.', 'do you want to meet 25 new guys?” it was a very slow process.', 'fortunately, we had time because this was mid-january and the finale doesn’t air until mid-march.', 'i know two months doesn’t seem like a lot, and the feelings are still raw, but she still just wanted to keep trying.', 'i think when you’ve had great tragedy in your life, like she’s had, there is a resilience that starts to come in, and you realize that for better or worse, life goes on and you’re better off taking a chance.', 'so we moved slowly [asking her to be “the bachelorette”], but when she came around to it, it got really exciting.', 'it started very slowly and then it got very serious in the middle of february.', 'she actually hadn’t signed until basically a couple of days ago, so it was definitely a lot of thinking.', 'she’s also very close with her family and i don’t know if her family wanted her to jump right back into a show that caused her so much heartbreak, but they are supportive and that’s fantastic.', 'there’s been a lot of discussion surrounding the lack of diversity with leads on “the bachelor” franchise, and just last year, rachel lindsay was the first-ever african american lead on “the bachelorette.” what went into the decision naming becca next season’s lead?', 'i’m super proud of this cast [from arie’s season].', 'we look at everything, and diversity is not only ethnicity, but also it’s the types of women that we had, and i was really happy that we had a lot of types of different women.', 'we had a lot of professional women and strong women who are their own women.', 'with becca, it was really a no-brainer decision.', 'i think everybody, after they see how this plays out, they’re going to want to see her get her happy ending.', 'this is a girl who’s been through so much — she lost her dad to brain cancer, her mother had a battle with breast cancer.', 'she’s really strong and resilient, and you really root for her after the finale.', 'earlier in the season, becca’s boyfriend from her past showed up, and a lot of people on twitter criticized that scene for seeming staged, solely to create drama.', 'he obviously didn’t just pop up in peru, so how did he show up?', 'i’m really glad you asked that.', 'we sit down at the end of every season and we look at things and we say, “this is good, this worked, people didn’t like this, or people responded to this.” for me and the producers, something that really didn’t sit right was when demario’s [jackson] girlfriend came back in rachel’s [lindsay] season — it just felt completely fake and it felt like this woman had a speech prepared and was ready to go — so when you see all of that, if it plays as false, then it pulls on a sweater thread and the whole thing can fall apart because it all seems false, and it’s not.', 'so in this case, this guy reached out to production and said he heard becca was on the show and he was really upset and wanted to see her.', 'and as a producer, you think, ‘that’s a great storyline, if it’s authentic.’ but at the very least, we had to make sure that this guy was willing to put up the money to get to peru, and see if this guy is genuine and didn’t want to just get on tv — and he did.', 'so once we realized that this guy really has feelings for becca and he wants to go, we did it.', 'this was a guy that becca had spoken about many times on the show as the one big relationship that she had, and seven years, that’s a long time.', 'so that’s how it all came to be.', 'why did you originally cast arie as this season’s lead?', 'is it because he is a bit older, and perhaps ready for a real relationship?', 'it’s funny because arie is the same age as nick [viall], but i think the reason why arie comes off as older is because he has a more mature lifestyle.', 'nick viall almost feels like an early-to-mid 20-something who is still figuring himself out and moved to l.a. arie lives in scottsdale, ariz., where he’s showing houses, and he’s even slowed down with the racing.', 'he’s a grown-up.', 'i think that’s the difference, and that’s part of what went into the decision-making.', 'i thought nick’s season was great and i absolutely love nick, but you watched that finale last year and he got engaged to vanessa [grimaldi], and it should have been this full-circle moment for him because he got so close with andi [dorfmann] and then he got so close with kaitlyn [bristowe] and then he finally found this person and it just felt like this thing is going to last for five minutes — and that’s what ended up happening.', 'and everyone has to do their own thing so i’m not decrying anything that he did.', 'but it just felt like we really wanted to find someone who was going to leave the spotlight after this was over, and that’s arie.', 'he was never one of those people that was really on social media and stayed in “the bachelor” circle.', 'he was just living his life.', 'it seems like the intention in casting arie was to make this season the most authentic it could possibly be when it comes to looking for love, so why do you think ratings were down this season?', 'i don’t know, but i will tell you that i was surprised when the ratings were up when nick [viall] was “the bachelor,” so sometimes you just don’t know.', 'nick was a roll-of-the-dice because he’d been on “bachelor in paradise,” which is not usually the breeding ground for the lead, so sometimes you can’t put your finger on these things.', 'when sean lowe was “the bachelor,” it really came down to him and arie, and it was down to the wire because people really wanted to see arie be “the bachelor” because he was so heartbroken by emily [maynard] so when we were making “the bachelor” this year, it was surprising how many people said they didn’t know who he was.', 'i know five years is not yesterday, but it’s also not so long ago.', 'he was somebody who always remained in the conversation with fans — maybe not as many as i thought, but i thought there was a lot of appeal for arie, and it was fascinating to see that we had to re-educate people [on arie] on i think arie also had to re-educate himself what it’s like to be on this type of show.', 'i think he has a lot of personality, and it’s really on us for not showing more of that.', 'you saw on “the women tell all” that he is really very funny, and i think if we had maybe shown more of that, maybe that would have helped.', 'also, we premiered on new year’s day and then the next day was the college football championship game and then you had the olympics, so we had a lot of strikes against us.', 'but it still felt like people cared — i heard a lot of chatter about the season online.', 'so you believe the numbers being down are due to competing programming and perhaps the lack of awareness for arie — not any sort of “bachelor” fatigue among audiences?', 'i don’t think there’s “bachelor” fatigue.', 'the people that are watching, certainly all seem to like it and live for it.', 'they might not like certain elements, but i haven’t seen anyone say, “i’m done watching ‘the bachelor.’” but it is an interesting time right now in the world, and there might be people who say, “i just don’t feel like i can get an escape right now because the world is in a weird place.”  on the flip side of that, do you think the political climate and intense news cycle serve as a benefit to the show because it can be an escape for viewers?', 'i think that’s right.', 'even when things are horrible on the show, as we’ve seen in this finale, there still is a measure of hope.', 'at the end of the day, we are trying to make a version of a fairytale here and there is something about love that is hopeful, even when it is love that’s lost.', 'there’s always going to be hope at the end of the day.', 'there is something hopeful and escapist about this show.', 'we’ve all made a fool of ourselves or gotten dumped, so i think there’s so much relatability to show.', 'what do you expect becca’s season of “the bachelorette” to be like?', 'this could be one of the stranger seasons of

come to dinner and has norma kind of propped up on the table, there was a real poignancy in having norman realize that all avenues were closed to him.', 'he doesn’t want to go to a mental institution, he can’t exist in this world, he’s in a degrading mental state.', 'there was no other solution for him.', 'why didn’t emma (olivia cooke) call the police when she knew dylan was going into the

mythology of psycho at the end.', 'particularly when we cast rihanna, we leaned into the fact that the audience would come to it with these very specific expectations based on the movie, and we wanted to flip their expectations on their ear.', 'that was fun to do, but as far as the ending goes, we were never judging it against the ending in psycho or felt an obligation to connect it to the ending

satisfying.', 'psycho aside, was there any point where you second-guessed your decision to kill norman?', 'ehrin: no.', 'certainly a part of you wants to somehow have everything turn out ok just

past and kind of redo it.', 'how did you come up with the idea to reincorporate the pilot into the episode?', 'cuse: one of the things that’s always satisfying in finales is to remind audiences of the journey they’ve been on.', 'there’s a resonance in rewarding an audience that has watched all 50 episodes of our show with a sense of that journey.', 'some of it arose from those feelings.', 'it was

deserved to come out of this with a relatively happy ending.', 'ehrin: there was something really interesting toward the end of the second season to have these two people who were both really outside of the norma-norman island and couldn’t get on it, that they would find each other and miraculously make their own world together.', 'it made us happy to think about, and it became something that was fun to work toward in the writing.', 'you do try to balance it — even on a purely selfish level for your own self.', 'when you’re living inside of this stuff, it’s very dark, and it’s nice to have strands of hope to hold onto.', 'that played out even in writing norma and norman, because you would constantly have to put yourself in denial about the ending.', 'you wanted to always infuse them
