stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and bachelor covers, these fateful shots of jamie foxx and katie holmes holding hands on the beach in malibu immediately made waves.', 'to understand the magnitude of holmes and foxx’s pda, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-trump era when brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a chainsmoker was.', 'in 2013, photos surfaced of foxx and holmes dancing together at a hamptons charity event.', 'ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they’re just friends, with varying degrees of success.', 'in an october 2013 interview, foxx called the dating rumors “one hundred percent not true.” again in 2015, foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, “what i’ve learned about society today is that they’re so thirsty.', 'especially in tabloid world and social media world, they’re so thirsty to find any story… sometimes when you read the stuff you’re like, ‘wow!', 'that’s so not true!’” holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether.', 'when pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, “that’s not something i want to answer.”  despite jamkat’s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they’ve been allegedly dating.', 'a blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with foxx’s friend, reality tv star claudia jordan, who gushed that foxx “is very happy with [holmes].” jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling et that, “i have no knowledge of jamie with katie at all,” adding, “i’ve never seen them together.', 'he’s never told me he’s dating her.”  still, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted.', 'anonymous sources insisted on jamie and katie’s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than jennifer aniston’s phantom pregnancy, never gave up.', 'while any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a people cover or a clickbait headline, jamkat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing.', 'that’s because foxx and holmes’ intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of holmes’ 2012 divorce from tom cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.', 'long before holmes and cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior—the alleged result of his close relationship with the church of scientology.', 'one of the main celebrity faces of scientology, cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church.', 'in going clear: scientology and the prison of belief, alex gibney’s 2015 documentary, marty rathbun, a former high-ranking scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage cruise’s second marriage: “i was to facilitate the breakup with nicole kidman.”  according to the film, scientology head david miscavige—a good friend of cruise’s—became suspicious of kidman when she began to influence cruise away from the church.', 'gibney’s film claims that over the course of their marriage, cruise even stopped returning miscavige’s calls.', 'at that point, the documentary alleges, miscavige resolved to get kidman out of the picture.', 'rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping kidman, “auditing” cruise, and “re-educating” the couple’s adopted children, connor and isabella.', 'this all culminated in 2001, when cruise divorced kidman.', 'a 2012 vanity fair article claimed that miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find cruise a new girlfriend.', 'maureen orth reported that, “the organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: ‘what do you think of tom cruise?’” the search party, orth reported, eventually landed on homeland actress nazanin boniadi.', 'between 2004 and 2005, boniadi reportedly dated the actor: “in a month-long preparation in october 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life.', 'boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.”  when boniadi was eventually flown to new york to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement “specifically about cruise,” claimed vanity fair.', 'and while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both cruise and miscavige: “by the third week in january, she was asked to move into scientology’s celebrity centre.', 'boniadi was told that cruise ‘wants someone with her own power—like nicole.’ when she asked why cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.” (the church of scientology did not respond to the daily beast’s requests for comment prior to publication.)', 'by april of 2005, cruise was dating actress katie holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on oprah winfrey’s couch.', 'according to journalist tony ortega, who’s covered the church since 1995, “katie made the effort initially to become a scientologist herself, and then escaped later.” ortega told the daily beast about the actress’ scientology handler, jessica rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany holmes during the batman begins press tour, recalling, “jessica was answering questions for katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.” rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples’ six-year marriage.', '(miscavige was cruise’s best man at his and holmes’ 2006 wedding.)', 'according to one particularly striking claim, cruise allegedly insisted that “his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby suri,” in keeping with scientology founder l. ron hubbard’s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.', 'as the daily beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and cruise’s young daughter, suri: “when cruise and holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter suri off to sea org—an elite training division of the church that requires its members to sign a ‘billion-year contract.’” cruise and holmes’ hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that suri would have no relationship with the church of scientology.', 'unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on suri’s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together.', 'in late june, intouch reported that cruise hadn’t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in “more than 1,381 days.” this alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church’s practice of “disconnecting” congregants from family members who disapprove of scientology.', 'a radaronline report from last year alleged holmes and foxx’s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement.', 'the gossip site published a source who claimed that, “katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing tom in various ways, like talking about him or scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.', '“she’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, suri,” the source continued.', '“katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”  and the timing works out: holmes and cruise finalized their divorce in june 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark.', 'if the rumors are true, holmes and foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from

level of fame.', 'though she has maintained that they didn’t become romantically involved until he and aniston had split, the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of w, which did a 32-page spread of them playing house, with a pretend brood of five.', 'aniston was devastated.', 'for pitt, dating jolie meant doing it her way, at least at the outset.', 'it marked the beginning of his own philanthropic life—in africa, haiti, and new orleans—and he formally adopted maddox and zahara.', 'he persuaded jolie to have biological children.', 'she gave birth to shiloh in 2006, in namibia, then the twins, vivienne and knox, in 2008. in between they adopted pax, then three, from vietnam.', 'they bought more homes—in france, spain, new york, and new orleans.', 'while pitt, as a producer and actor, churned out one prestige movie after another (moonlight, the tree of life, moneyball, 12 years a slave), jolie took a new chance with directing—with in the land of blood and honey, about bosnia, a project inspired by some of the u.n. work she’d done there.', 'together, they appeared unstoppable, the most creatively alive citizens on the planet.', 'nothing seemed beyond their abilities.', 'they traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight, making art, doing good, and setting up home wherever they happened to be.', 'they tied the knot in 2014, mainly because the kids wanted them to.', 'they had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went.', 'but jolie’s idea of an education meant immersion in the real world, to bring an understanding of one’s “small part in the bigger picture.” for a time, it all worked beautifully.', 'photographs by mert alas and marcus piggott.', 'styled by jessica diehl.', 'it was 2012, and jolie had recently finished in the land of blood and honey.', 'she wanted her next project to be just as meaningful, and ung’s story had at this point been with her for a decade.', 'by the time they had a completed draft, the chance for jolie to direct unbroken, based on the best-selling book by laura hillenbrand, had come along, and they put the script aside.', 'after that, maddox, who knew “auntie” loung’s story, brought it up.', '“he was the one who said, ‘it’s time to do it,’ ” says jolie.', 'she knew that maddox would be deeply involved in the production, that he’d be “standing there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other.', '[so] he had to be ready.” jolie and ung dived back in.', 'credited on the film as an executive producer, maddox read draft after draft, giving comments.', 'jolie took it to netflix, where chief creative officer ted sarandos signed on without hesitation.', '“in the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be,” recalls sarandos.', '“the film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the khmer rouge had killed all things beautiful, color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life. . . . that’s what hooked me more than anything.” despite jolie’s cambodian ties, she felt she needed a cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project.', 'so she reached out to rithy panh, one of the most famous filmmakers in cambodia, who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the khmer rouge in several documentaries, including the missing picture, which was nominated for the best-foreign-language-film academy award in 2014. she and panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if cambodia wanted it to be—not a foregone conclusion, given that cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history.', '(the killing fields, roland joffé’s 1984 film about the khmer rouge, had to be filmed in thailand and elsewhere.)', 'the war tribunals, which were set in motion in 2009 and are ongoing, have helped open up the topic.', 'still, jolie was trepidatious and approached the country’s culture ministers gingerly, explaining that they were telling not just ung’s story but also the story of a people.', 'jolie’s cambodian track record made the difference, says ung.', '“in a country like cambodia, respect is very much elevated—respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders.', 'angie walks in cambodia with this respect.” cambodia went all in—closing off battambang for days, giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones, providing them with 500 officials from their actual army to play the khmer rouge army.', '“it’s not a poetic thing to say—[this film] was made by the country,” says jolie.', 'between cast and crew, some 3,500 cambodians participated.', 'to cast the children in the film, jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship.', 'in order to find their lead, to play young loung ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away.', 'the director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie.', '“srey moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,” jolie says.', '“when she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion.', 'all these different things came flooding back.” jolie then tears up.', '“when she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn’t have enough money for a nice funeral.” that authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved, says jolie, making for a film set like nothing she’d ever seen.', '“there wasn’t a person who was working on the movie who didn’t have a personal connection.', 'they weren’t coming to do a job.', 'they were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it .', '. . it completed something for them.” some had flashbacks and nightmares.', 'for this reason, a therapist was on set every day.', 'and then there were the odd bystanders who hadn’t been aware that a movie was being made, and were traumatized.', 'in one scene, recalls jolie, “when the khmer rouge came over the bridge, we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed.', 'they were horrified to see them come back.” given the size and complexity of the production, a different hollywood director might have, consciously or not, muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish.', 'according to ung and panh, jolie knows cambodia so well she’s internalized the country’s character traits.', 'at lunch, she waited in line like everyone else, recalls panh, and she never raised her voice.', '“here we don’t shout.', 'we talk,” he says.', 'in cambodia, yelling is not just disrespectful—it’s also considered a sign of weakness.', 'photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott.', 'styled by jessica diehl.', 'many eyes were on maddox, who is as famous in cambodia as jolie.', '“it was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,” says jolie, who wasn’t sure how he’d ultimately react to the experience.', 'would he connect?', 'would he want to flee?', 'jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard maddox say, “can i go sleep in my house with my friends?,” referring to their house in the jungle, which she had bought back in 2002.', '“i hadn’t heard him refer to it that way.', 'you can’t push it.', 'you can’t say, ‘isn’t this great?’ you just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them .', '. . and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.” she considers the endeavor to connect maddox to his homeland—as she does zahara to ethiopia and pax to vietnam—a family effort, not a solo one.', 'with that in mind, while pitt was in the middle east working on war machine, the other five kids also went to cambodia and played a role, official or not, in their mother’s movie.', 'pax did still photography.', 'the other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors.', 'in february, the film premiered for an audience of 1,000 at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of angkor wat.', 'according to numerous reports, it was a screening filled with tears of recognition, remembrance, and catharsis.', 'what moved jolie perhaps more than anything was that “the cambodian people had a big movie premiere.', 'they saw a movie for which they made the sets.', '[it was] their actors doing a great job, their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors.”  alas, while she was making film history for a country, her relationship with pitt was suffering.', 'by the time first they killed my father was in postproduction, in the summer of 2016, “things got bad,” says jolie.', '“i didn’t want to use that word. . . . things became ‘difficult.’ ” there has been hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on pitt, and that he was craving a more stable, normal life for the whole family.', 'when i bring this question up to her, it’s the one moment when jolie becomes a bit defensive.', '“[our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,” she says quickly,

harnessed correctly.', '(speaking of harnessed correctly, i wouldn’t mind seeing todrick hall in a harness, if he’s taking requests for his next video.)', 'meanwhile, bobby got rid of the cat pee

california, so it wasn’t quite dark out.', 'also, the production is painfully sincere in that way michael jackson loved: instead of reaching into his packed back catalog, he performed “we are the

“stop in the name of love” with tuxedo-clad dancers all around her.', 'then you realize that ross has changed her outfit for every single song.', 'and then you realize that the giant gold cape she’s wearing is slowly enveloping the entire stage as she rises three stories in the air, singing “ain’t no mountain high enough.” and then you realize that helicopter is going to land in the middle of the

rest of nsync doing “bye bye bye” while steven tyler pulled heartstrings with “i don’t want to miss a thing” might not seem revolutionary — especially considering the dated metallic outfits — but it definitely felt that way at the time.', 'this was the first year that fans were allowed on the field surrounding the stage, which made the show feel more like a traditional concert — granted one where

only guests were her former destiny’s child bandmates, who together sung “single ladies,” which wasn’t even one of their songs.', 'still, beyoncé only had women performers on that stage, an admirable

his mortal character would interact with an amazon, pine stated, when i first read the script, it had elements of romancing the stone, kind of a very classic fish out of water.', 'two people that dont really bond well at first and theyre butting heads and just fun, witty banter.', '[15] when speaking about meeting the director and being cast, pine said, patty is a pretty incredible human being.', 'when we first met about the part of steve, she sat across from me and essentially acted out the entire film over the course of a two-hour lunch.', 'she was so specific, so articulate, and so

describing her character mentoring and training diana to be a warrior, wright said, its a sixth sense that it is coming and i think thats also in the mythological story behind antiope and queen hippolyta.', 'they know its coming and its her duty as the aunt to her young niece to make sure she is the fiercest warrior of all time.', 'on the amazons fighting style, wright said, its hand combat.', 'yes, swords and knives and arrows, but the precision that they have, right, as these warrior women; its so nice to see that disparity between what we had in the day of just raw fighting materials and the guns and how easy that is in comparison.', 'the message of the film, wright stated, is not just female empowerment.', 'its about love and justice.', 'thats what the films about.', 'and what a great message to spread to our little ones.', '[26][27] commenting about training for the film, wright said, the most empowering was to get into that physical shape.', 'so we were doing

as a pragmatist, realist, patriotic, fighting for his country, further explaining, he lost his son on the german front lines and was just quite tortured, diabolical, stubborn and believes that what hes doing is for the betterment of mankind.', '[30] on his character, huston said, ludendorff is a believer that war is a natural habitat for humans.', 'huston stated the film as an anti-war film and somebody like ludendorff would probably think that the idea that love conquers all is quite a naive concept.', 'but finally its true and sometimes the best way to examine mankind is from another perspective.', 'on the genre of the film, huston said, its greek mythology.', 'its the origin of story and sometimes we need demigods to look at us to understand what our weaknesses are.', 'it serves the mythological world.', '[31]  the greek god of war, zeuss treacherous son and half-brother of diana, based on the greek mythological god of war, who masquerades as sir patrick morgan, a speaker for

off from the get-go.', 'we couldnt stop talking.', 'what was supposed to be a one-hour meeting turned into a two-and-a-half-hour lunch and we just really got each other.', '[37] she described jenkinss directing style for the film as shes also the kind of director that i really flourish under.', 'she has very strong and particular and specific ideas about what it is she wants to say.', 'she comes

familiarize herself with women warriors and said i used what i learned in mayors book as a rallying cry for how i approached hippolyta.', 'and then, of course, what is a leader who is elected by her

provoke as much pain as possible.', 'she researched world war i and fritz haber, the scientist who created mustard gas, to prepare for the role.', '[41] on the characters facial scars, anaya stated, i went to patty jenkins and asked, what happened to her?', 'and she said, she did it on purpose.', 'i was like, what?', 'patty, youre going further than i ever imagined.', 'she said, she wants to provoke painful suffering, so she tested her own gas on her own face.', 'she wanted to know how deep this form of her gas would go, so she put it on her own face.', 'you can see half of her face is completely gone.', 'this is the sadistic side of dr. maru.', 'she also stated her character is quite the opposite to the lead role of this movie, one of the strongest characters ever of dc comics, wonder woman.', 'i can tell you that doctor poison is someone with a capacity to provoke so much pain.', '[42] on dr. marus relationship with general ludendorff, anaya said, i think that they have a relationship based on loyalty.', 'ludendorff is a very tormented general that lacks self-confidence.', 'thats why, in part, he takes these drugs that dr. poison gives him.', 'they are from different worlds, but they complement each other.', '[43]  steve trevors secretary who befriends diana.', '[44] describing her character, davis said, shes a woman in a mans world and so being heard and seen arent the easiest things, but it kind of doesnt deter her, adding, etta is unapologetically herself and i think that thats the thing that has drawn me to her the most.', '[45] when asked if she was previously familiar with the character, davis responded, no.', 'i wasnt.', 'it took me a while to know that i was auditioning for etta because even when i found out it was wonder woman, i still had no idea what the role was.', 'it took a little while then i googled the character.', '[46] on etta candys relationship with steve trevor, davis said, one of the great things that etta gets to work with steve trevor is because steve is not your typical man, in that he does entrust her with things that in 1918 probably wouldnt have been entrusted to a secretary of somebody who is quite important, further explaining, so i think that [trevor] needs her just as much as she needs that because now shes been given responsibility that she wouldnt have normally be given before, and equally he has somebody who could probably fly under the radar a bit.', 'so he can trust the person who no ones really looking at.', '[47]  saïd taghmaoui as sameer:  a secret agent and ally of steve trevor.',

literally until a month later, i got a call saying i got the role and they wanted me to fly to london for a fitting.', '[54] brave rock raised several concerns with jenkins over the representation of

during world war ii, the script impressed executives at silver pictures.', '[77] however, silver stated that he had purchased the script because he did not want the rights reverting; while stating the

is smart and independent and emotional.', 'she can be confused.', 'she can lose her confidence.', 'she can have confidence.', 'she is everything.', 'she has a human heart.', '[7]  this version was conceived of as a prequel to the first live-action, theatrical appearance of wonder woman, in the 2016 film, batman v superman: dawn of justice,[96] placing wonder woman in the 1910s and world war i (a decision which differs from her comic book origins as a supporter of the allies during world war ii).', '[97] as for story development, jenkins credits the stories by the characters creator william moulton marston in the 1940s and george perezs seminal stories in the 1980s in which he modernized the character.', '[98] in addition, it follows some aspects of dc comics origin changes in the new 52

looked for—all the values that wonder woman stands for exuding from someone in an honest way, and boy did they find it [...] she shares every quality with wonder woman and thats no joke.', 'its one of those rare things.', 'you need someone who can appear to be wonder woman on screen [...] every once in a while, theres superhero casting that transcends, because that person is so authentic to the

in the role of wonder woman for the 2016 film, batman v superman: dawn of justice over élodie yung and olga kurylenko.', '[102][103][104][105] some fans initially reacted to this choice by criticizing gadots appearance.', '[106] snyder would later comment on his decision to cast gadot, stating that he tested a bunch of actresses, as you can imagine.', 'but the thing with gal is that shes strong, shes beautiful, and shes a kind person, which is interesting, but fierce at the same time.', 'its that combination of being fierce but kind at the same time that we were looking for.', '[107] gadot described diana as having the heart of a human so she can be emotional, shes curious, shes compassionate, she loves people.', 'and then she has the powers of a goddess.', 'shes all for good, she fights for good.', '[7] she also said that diana has many strengths and powers, but at the end of the day shes a woman with a lot of emotional intelligence.', '[108] as to how her character is different from her appearance in batman v superman: dawn of justice, gadot said we go back 100 years to when shes more naive, further explaining, shes this young idealist.', 'shes pure.', 'very different to the experienced, super-confident, grown-up woman youve seen.', '[109] gadot underwent a diet and training regimen, practiced different martial arts and gained 17 pounds of muscle for the role.', '[110][111] gadot was previously offered a different role (as a villain) in man of steel, which she declined because she was pregnant at the time; this allowed her to later be cast as wonder woman in the films follow-up.', '[112] gadot signed a three-picture deal.', '[104] she was paid a base salary of $300,000 for the film itself.', '[113]  chris pine was cast as steve trevor,[21][114] a

notes from richard donner than from christopher nolan, patty jenkins wonder woman provides a welcome respite from dcs house style of grim darkness—boisterous, earnest, sometimes sloppy, yet consistently entertaining—with star gal gadot proving an inspired choice for this avatar of truth, justice, and the amazonian way.', '[209] ”  vox stated trevor is the superhero girlfriend comic book movies need.', '[210] the san francisco chronicles mick lasalle lauded the performances of gadot, pine, huston, and thewlis while commending the films different perspective and humor.', '[211] richard roeper of chicago sun-times described gadots performance as inspirational, heroic, heartfelt and endearing and the most real wonder woman portrayal.', '[212]  a. o. scott of the new york times wrote that it briskly shakes off blockbuster branding imperatives and allows itself to be something relatively rare in the modern superhero cosmos.', 'it feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like ... whats the word im looking for?', 'a movie.', 'a pretty good one, too.', '[213] michael phillips of chicago tribune compared the film to captain america: the first avenger, noting that as with the first captain america movie over in the marvel comics universe, dcs wonder woman offers the pleasures of period re-creation for a popular audience.', 'jenkins and her design team make 1918-era london; war-torn belgium; the ottoman empire; and other locales look freshly realized, with a strong point of view.', 'there are scenes here of dispossessed war refugees, witnessed by an astonished and heartbroken diana, that carry unusual gravity for a comic book adaptation.', '[214] katie erbland of indiewire commended its thematic depth, explaining that wonder woman is a war movie.', 'patty jenkins first—and we hope not last—entry into the dc expanded universe is primarily set during world war i, but while the feature doesnt balk at war-time violence, its the internal battles of its compelling heroine that are most vital.', '[215] alonso duralde of thewrap similarly felt that, dianas scenes of action are thrilling precisely because theyre meant to stop war, not to foment it; the idea of a demi-god using love to fight war might sound goofy in the abstract, but jenkins makes the concept work.', '[216] ann hornaday of the washington post praised gadot and pines performances as well the films detailed plot and narrative while comparing of some slow-motion action sequences to the matrix.', '[217] stephanie zacharek of time magazine hailed the film as a cut above nearly all the superhero movies that have been trotted out over the past few summers while praising gadots performance as charming and marvelous and commending jenkinss direction of the film as a step forward for women directors in directing big-budget blockbuster films in hollywood.', '[218]  elise jost of moviepilot observed that gadots take on wonder woman is one of those unique cases of an actor merging with their story, similar to robert downey jr.s tony stark.', 'gal gadot is wonder woman, and wonder woman is gal gadot.', '[202] jost praised gadots interpretation of wonder woman as the one in which gadot absolutely nails the characters unwaveringly positive outlook on life.', 'shes a force of nature who believes in the greater good; her conviction that shes meant to save the world is stronger than her bullet-deflecting shield.', 'shes genuine, shes fun, shes the warm source of energy at the heart of the movie.', '[202] the federalist suggests that wonder woman is a story of jesus.', 'the movie is wrapped up in faux greek mythology, true, but theres no mistaking the christology here.', '[219] perhaps christ in the form of a beautiful and kick-ass amazon is all that our contemporary society can handle right now, stated m. hudson, a christian feminist.', '[219] on huffpost cultural critic, g. roger denson, who regards the superhero genre as a source of contemporary mainstream mythopoetics (the making of new yet vitally meaningful, if not symbolic, stories filled with imagery reflecting, yet also shaping and advancing, the political, legal, moral and social practices of today), wrote that the no mans land scene that people are crying over in theaters and raving about afterward happens to be among the most powerfully mythopoetic scenes ever filmed at the same time it is one of the oldest myths to have been utilized by artists and writers after it had been invented by early military strategists and leaders.', 'specifically used by director patty jenkins, the scene raises the esteem for powerful yet compassionate women as heroes and leaders to a level equal with that of men for having won over a huge and adoring popular audience around the world.', '[220]  steve rose in the guardian criticized the film for failing to explore the materials potential for patriarchy-upending subversion.', '[221] peter travers of rolling stone criticized the films over-reliance on exposition: wonder woman is hobbled by a slogging origin story and action that only comes in fits and starts.', 'just when gadot and director patty jenkins...are ready to kick ass, we get backstory.', '[222]  gas was intended to win the war.', 'on that much wonder woman is absolutely right.', 'said david hambling in popular mechanics.', '[223] rachel becker of the verge stated that despite the scientific liberties of using a hydrogen-based chemical weapon as a plot device, the film succeeds in evoking real and horrifying history.', 'first off, mustard gas is such a horrible, terrifying weapon, it doesnt need to be made more potent.', 'but if you were a chemist bent on raining destruction on the allied forces, you wouldnt do it by replacing the sulfur atom in mustard gas with a hydrogen atom.', 'youd know that sulfur is the linchpin holding together this poisonous molecule.', '[224]  articles about the film and its star were the most visited on the english wikipedia.', '[225]  cultural impact [ edit ]  wonder woman has been the subject of a discussion regarding the appearance and representation of female power in general, and of female action heroes in particular[226] since her initial 1941 appearance in sensation comics,[226] as she was created to document the growth in the power of women, while wearing a golden tiara, a red bustier, blue underpants and knee-high, red leather boots.', '[227] she was blacklisted a year later in 1942 in the publications disapproved for youth because, the group behind the list argued, she was not sufficiently dressed.', '[227][228]  a few decades later, second-wave feminist gloria steinems[229] ms. magazine debuted in 1972 with an image of wonder woman on the cover.', 'historian tim hanley suggests that this move shifted the focus away from female superiority to sisterhood and equality, essentially making her a mascot of the womens movement.', '[226][230][231] this perception shifted over the years, as demonstrated in december 2016 when the united nations decided to drop the title of honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls which it had given to the comic book character wonder woman a few months prior, in a ceremony attended by the actors who had portrayed her (lynda carter and gal gadot).', '[232] the title was eliminated in response to a petition signed by 44,000 people which argued that wonder woman undermines female empowerment due to her costume, described as a shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an american flag motif and knee-high boots.', 'the petition stated that it is alarming that the united nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in united states and the world is the objectification of women and girls.', '[233][234][230] wonder woman director patty jenkins responded to both the petition and to the u.n.s decision by stating that she thinks that thats sexist.', 'i think its sexist to say you cant have both.', 'i have to ask myself what i would apply to any other superhero.', '[235]  the debate continued with the release of jenkinss 2017 film, wonder woman, which according to the bbc had some thinking its too feminist and others thinking its not feminist enough.', '[236] kyle killian found an inherent contradiction in the construction of wonder woman as a warrior who, she states, is also highly sexualized.', 'killian thus suggests that these elements should not be the focus of a kickass heroine—her beauty, bone structure, and sexiness—if she is to be a feminist icon.', '[237] theresa harold concurred, comparing wonder woman to katniss everdeen (of the hunger games), who didnt have to wear a teenagers wet dream of a costume to fight in.', '[238] christina cauterucci also felt that wonder womans ability to be considered a feminist antidote was undermined by her sex appeal.', '[239] other critics refer to the construction of wonder woman in the film as an implausible post-feminist hero.', '[228][240]  jenkins disagrees with this line of critique.', 'she has stated that she was raised by a second-wave feminist mother,[241][242] who taught her to be both super aware that there had been sexism but also: congratulations—thank you, now i get to do whatever i want, mom!', '[241] jenkins thus notes that it is this upbringing which has led her to question a feminist critique of wonder womans costume.', '[243] when she was working on her own version of wonder womans gladiator re-design of the outfit (in the 2016 film batman v superman: dawn of justice)[244] jenkins decided that wonder woman (as well as the other amazons) shouldnt be dressed in armor like men [...] it should be different [...] i, as a woman, want wonder woman to be hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same time—the same way men want superman to have huge pecs and an impractically big body.', '[17] jenkins also notes that she is frustrated by the critique of wonder womans appearance, stating when people get super critical about her outfit, whos the one getting crazy about what a woman wears?', 'thats who she is; thats wonder woman.', '[242] gal gadot concurred with jenkins, arguing that the character is a feminist[245] as feminism is about equality and choice and freedom.', 'and the writers, patty and myself all figured that the best way to show that is to show diana as having no awareness of social roles.', 'she has no gender boundaries.', 'to her, everyone is equal.', '[246]  critics such as valerie estelle frankel support jenkinss vision.', 'frankel argues that the film subverts the male gaze,[243] stating that the construction of wonder woman tends to shift every few decades as it reflects the state of feminism during different time periods, including third-wave feminism (which reflects jenkinss approach).', '[243][247][248] zoe williams offers a similar argument, stating that while wonder woman is sort of naked a lot of the time, that is not, at the same time, objectification so much as a cultural reset: having thighs, actual thighs you can kick things with, not thighs that look like arms, is a feminist act.', '[249] williams then juxtaposes wonder woman to past female action heroes such as sarah connor, ellen ripley, and lara croft, whom she suggests were all constructed for the male gaze, in which a female warrior becomes a sex object, (a point which she argues that jenkins directly references in the film).', '[249]  gloria steinem also liked the film, stating that she felt it made the amazon origin story clear; [wonder woman] was stopping war, not perpetuating it.', 'steinem also noted that she knew some women were disappointed by all the makeup, but i may be desperate—i was just happy that the amazons had wild hair!', 'her only complaint lay in the choice to eliminate the world war ii setting as the wonder woman comic book developed in response to existing comics that were so sadistic and racist that there was a congressional hearing on the subject.', '[250] steinem also gave hillary clinton the first wonder woman award in october 2017 during the womens media centers speaking truth to power awards (an organization created by steinem, jane fonda, and robin morgan).', 'upon receiving the award, clinton noted that she had seen jenkinss wonder woman film and that she loved the outfit.', 'she also said that as her granddaughter was really keen on wonder woman, clinton thought maybe i could borrow something from her for the night.', 'it didnt quite work for me, but i will say that this award means a lot to me because as a little girl, and then as a young woman, and then as a slightly older woman, i always wondered when wonder woman would have her time, and now that has happened.', '[251] clinton had previously praised jenkinss film, in a public august 2017 message, stating that it was just as inspirational as id suspected a movie about a strong, powerful woman in a fight to save the world from international disaster would be.', '[252][253][254]  director james cameron continued this debate, through his critique of the representation of female power in jenkinss film.', 'in an august 2017 interview with the guardian, cameron qualifies jenkinss vision of wonder woman as an objectified icon and called the film a step backwards.', 'in contrast, he states, his character sarah connor (from his terminator films) was not a beauty icon.', 'she was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit.', '[255] jenkins stated in response that camerons inability to understand what wonder woman is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising as, though he is a great filmmaker, he is not a woman.', 'she further argued there is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman because if women have to always be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we arent free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we havent come very far have we.', '[256] reaction to this debate was mixed.', 'julie miller sided with cameron, whom she states refers to himself as a pretty hardcore feminist and who told vulture that i have no problem writing a script in which the males become subservient to the females, which is what happens in aliens [...] its up to ripley to win the day.', 'in contrast, miller argues that jenkins and gadot envisioned wonder woman as a woman who exuded both femininity and strength, along with genuine confusion as to why men would treat women differently than they do other men.', '[257] susannah breslin also agreed with cameron, describing jenkinss wonder woman as a playmate with a lasso and female power with no balls.', '[258] others were more critical of camerons critique.', '[259] an article in newsweek suggests that in contrast to his criticism of jenkins, camerons own films include lot of objectification and quotes a few hollywood celebrities who echoed this view.', 'one of the quotes came from jesse mclaren who states that james camerons just confused theres a female hero whose motivations arent centered around motherhood.', '[260] noah berlatsky found areas of agreement between both cameron and jenkins, stating that while camerons objection is an old point thats been made over and over for decades, jenkinss film is not solely focused on objectifying gal gadot for a male audience.', '[261]  a few weeks later in september, cameron reiterated his criticism in an interview with the hollywood reporter.', 'he compared gal gadots representation of the character to raquel welch films of the 1960s,[262] and reinforced a comparison with linda hamiltons portrayal of sarah connor.', 'he argued that connor was if not ahead of its time, at least a breakthrough in its time because though she looked great, she wasnt treated as a sex object.', '[262] he also stated that he while he applaud[s] patty directing the film and hollywood, uh, letting a woman direct a major action franchise, i didnt think there was anything groundbreaking in wonder woman.', 'i thought it was a good film.', 'period.', '[262] former wonder woman actress lynda carter responded to camerons the hollywood reporter interview by asking him to stop dissing ww.', 'like jenkins, she suggests that while cameron does not understand the character, she does.', 'she also refers to camerons critiques as thuggish jabs at a brilliant director that are as ill advised as the movie was spot on.', 'carter also states that she has the authority to make these observations because she has embodied this character for more than 40 years.', '[263][264][265] a month later, jenkins responded to camerons comments once again in an interview with variety, stating that she was not upset at all, as everybody is entitled to their own opinion.', 'but if youre going to debate something in a public way, i have to reply that i think its incorrect.', '[266] tricia ennis was also critical of camerons statements, arguing that while he may consider himself a feminist and an ally to women, [he] is not very good at it as being an ally means using his position of privilege without silencing the voices of those youre trying to help.', 'she also states that it is not enough to simply call yourself a feminist.', 'its not even enough to create a strong female character [...] you have to bring women to the table.', 'you have to let them speak.', 'you cannot speak for them.', 'but speaking for women is exactly what cameron is doing through his comments [...] cameron is using his position of power as a respected producer and director to silence women.', '[267]  accolades [ edit ]  sequel [ edit ]  originally signed for three feature films, with wonder woman and justice league being her second and third films, gadot signed an extension to her contract for additional films.', '[311] jenkins initially signed for only one film,[312] but in an interview with variety, geoff johns revealed that he and jenkins were writing the treatment for a wonder woman sequel and that he has a cool idea for the second one.', 'at the 2017 san diego comic con, warner bros. officially announced a sequel would be released on december 13, 2019, and would be titled wonder woman 2; the date was later moved up to november 1, 2019, to avoid competition with star wars: episode ix.', '[314][315] later, jenkins was officially signed to return as director, with confirmation that gadot will be returning as the titular role.', '[316] days later, the studio hired dave callaham to co-write the films script with jenkins and johns.', '[317] on march 9, 2018, kristen wiig was confirmed to play cheetah, the villain of the film.', '[318] later that month, it was announced that pedro pascal would have a key role in the film.', '[319] in may 2018, long-time dceu producer zack snyder confirmed on social media platform vero that he, along with wife deborah snyder, will serve as producers on the wonder woman sequel.', '[320] in june 2018, the title of the film was announced to be wonder woman 1984.', '[321]  notes [ edit ]  a b this is by an adjusted

speak out on the alleged sexual-misconduct allegations against his sometime employer.', '“it’s indefensible.', 'that’s the only word you can start with,” he says.', '“harvey’s admitted to it, and it’s indefensible.', 'i’ve known harvey for 20 years.', 'he gave me my first big break as an actor in films on from dusk till dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with confessions of a dangerous mind.', 'we’ve had dinners, we’ve been on location together, we’ve had arguments.', 'but i can tell you that i’ve never seen any of this behavior—ever.”  clooney spoke to me at length about the allegations—as well as charges of hollywood complicity—during a phone conversation late monday.', 'his remarks come in the wake of statements released by meryl streep and dame judi dench, two actresses who’ve won oscars for weinstein-shepherded films and who took the bullying movie mogul to task for allegedly preying on vulnerable young women for 30 years, resulting in at least eight settlements, according to a bombshell new york times exposé.', 'weinstein’s accusers, among them the actress ashley judd, shared similar horror stories: a “business meeting” at a lavish hotel suite soon gave way to a series of sexual propositions, including watching him shower.', 'one local tv reporter, lauren sivan, claimed that weinstein cornered her in the bowels of his restaurant, told her to “be quiet,” and masturbated into a potted plant.', 'weinstein, the former co-chief of miramax, has since been fired from the weinstein company—which he co-founded with his brother bob—and many of the male actors and filmmakers in particular who have benefited from the studio executive’s oscar midas touch, from matt damon and ben affleck (good will hunting) to quentin tarantino (pulp fiction), have remained alarmingly silent.', 'clooney, on the other hand, was anything but.', 'how did you react to the harvey weinstein news?', 'i’ve heard rumors, and the rumors in general started back in the ’90s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with harvey to get a role.', 'it seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn’t get the jobs based on their talent, so i took those rumors with a grain of salt.', 'but the other part of this, the part we’re hearing now about eight women being paid off, i didn’t hear anything about that and i don’t know anyone that did.', 'that’s a whole other level and there’s no way you can reconcile that.', 'there’s nothing to say except that it’s indefensible.', 'the thing i’ve been seeing online is that, in the wake of meryl streep’s statement, and knowing that he helped guide her to an oscar for the iron lady, many people are saying, “oh, she had to know.” but that seems both incredibly speculative and unfair.', 'a lot of people are doing the “you had to know” thing right now, and yes, if you’re asking if i knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young, beautiful women, sure.', 'but i had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence, and that these women were threatened and victimized.', 'i’ve been talking with a lot of people about this, and i don’t know many people who knew of that.', 'sharon waxman over at the wrap said she was working on a story about harvey over 10 years ago at the new york times and they killed it, and if that’s true, then that’s a shameful thing because a lot of women wouldn’t have been made victims if this had come out.', 'by the same token, i do want to say that sharon’s been running her own influential website, the wrap, for quite a long time, and if she did these interviews and this investigation, she didn’t run the story either, and i and a lot of other people would have liked to have known it.', 'a good bunch of people that i know would say, “yeah, harvey’s a dog” or “harvey’s chasing girls,” but again, this is a very different kind of thing.', 'this is harassment on a very high level.', 'and there’s an argument that everyone is complicit in it.', 'i suppose the argument would be that it’s not just about hollywood, but about all of us—that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don’t speak up, you’re complicit.', 'and there’s no question about that.', 'hollywood can be good when it comes to certain progressive causes, but this area—preying on women—seems to be a pretty major blind spot.', 'the “casting couch” and the “creepy, lecherous producer,” these are concepts that are so firmly ingrained in the industry that they’ve become troubling clichés, and go all the way back to golden age studio chiefs like louis b. mayer and david o. selznick.', 'i hear you.', 'at the same time, i know an awful lot more people in this business who have nothing to do with that, and i suppose if i went looking i could probably find three or four names of people that i would suspect of doing that.', 'the other part of it is, i’d like to think that if someone came up to me and told me this was going on that i would go out and confront it.', 'i’ve told this story about a night with silvio berlusconi, and i hadn’t told all the specifics about it before, but perhaps i should have been more graphic about how vulgar that was in a way to take some responsibility—each of us, in our own individual way—of talking about people with a lot of power using it and holding it over others in some ways.', 'but on the other hand, maybe that’s what good will come out of this: that not just in hollywood, although hollywood is now the focus, but in all of these cases the victims will feel that they will be listened to, and that they don’t need to be afraid.', 'this is an interesting moment.', 'i’ve seen a lot of people, from meryl [streep] to judi dench, come out and say “holy shit,” and i think that that’s been the reaction by a lot of people in hollywood.', 'i don’t think that people were looking the other way; i think that people weren’t looking, because in some ways, a lecherous guy with money picking up younger girls is unfortunately not a news story in our society.', 'so when you find out how much worse it is than you thought, then it’s a news story.', 'and this is a big news story now.', 'and i feel very bad for all of the victims.', 'i mean, cornering a young anchorwoman in the kitchen and jerking off into a potted plant?', 'that’s not just some rumor about harvey hitting on a woman; it’s disturbing on a whole lot of levels, because there had to be a lot of people involved in covering that up.', 'that’s frustrating.', 'if politicians knew these stories, i doubt they’d have been taking donations from him at the dnc [democratic national committee], and i hope that they will all give the money back or donate it to good causes.', 'those on the right, from fox news to donald trump jr., have used the harvey weinstein news as a cudgel against liberals.', 'it’s a bit rich on trump jr.’s part, given the numerous allegations against his father.', 'yeah, that’s a little pot and kettle there, unfortunately.', 'but i think that everything gets politicized these days.', 'the reality is that this is a problem deeply ingrained in our society.', 'it was something that was talked about a lot on the left with roger ailes, bill o’reilly, and donald trump, and it’s something that’s going to be talked about a lot on the right with harvey weinstein.', 'i think that rather than politicize it, there should be talk on both sides about the really bad behavior by powerful men and the horrible acts they commit.', 'it’s pretty crazy to me.', 'it is so firmly ingrained in the culture now.', 'we just elected a man president who’s been accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women and was caught on tape bragging to a relative stranger about his ability to sexually assault women at will.', 'one of the strange things about the harvey news is it emerged around the one-year anniversary of that trump access hollywood tape.', 'that is a funny part of it: in “liberal” hollywood the guy loses his job, but then this other guy [trump] gets elected president.', 'there are a couple of good things that have to come out of this, because something good has to come out of this.', 'one of those things is that victims have to feel safer to come out and tell their stories without the fear of losing their jobs, and they also need to be believed, which is a very important element of this.', 'also, this should be a shot across the bow that people in places of power cannot abuse that power, and if you do, you’ll be outed publicly, shamed, and even prosecuted.', 'when it comes to most of the people that i know, where we’re shocked is by how bad it was.', 'this is about show business but it isn’t just about show business—it’s about everything.', 'we need to get to a place where we can call these people out much quicker before it becomes such a deeper, long-running problem.', 'this apparently went on for almost 30 years.', 'people did know that harvey was a terrible bully, though.', 'it was interesting how hollywood approached it, because he was almost treated like a caricature—the angry, bellowing studio mogul.', 'i remember there was a character on entourage based on him.', 'it was treated almost like a joke.', 'think about it this way, too: i had knock-down, drag-out fights with him over the years, but he was also making films that other studios weren’t willing to make, and he was making films that everybody loved, so you just put up with certain bad behavior because you felt like, well, if he yells and screams but he gets pulp fiction made, who cares if he yells and screams?', 'but it’s a very different conversation when you say, it’s not that he yells and screams but that he’s cornering a young, scared lady in a restaurant and telling her to stand there and be quiet while he jerks off.', 'that’s a very different kind of behavior, and had that been a public thing, i think there would have been some different results.', 'i hope there would be.', 'why do you think people are holding him accountable now?', 'i wrote a piece about how there seems to be a lot more accountability surrounding issues of sexual assault and misconduct in hollywood, and that it’s perhaps a reaction to the cosby revelations, which served as a wake-up call for a lot of people in the entertainment media space—that in covering celebrities you can’t gloss over the dark details, otherwise you’re mildly complicit.', 'also, it’s so important how there are more women now in both hollywood and newsrooms who feel empowered to speak up and hold those in power accountable.', 'hopefully, this kind of behavior will end—or become harder and harder for it to continue.', 'what’s important now is that anybody who thinks that they can get away with doing that, they now have to think: wait, somebody can be recording this or writing a story about it.', 'i’m going to get in a lot of trouble.', 'that’s good, because we’ve seen this type of behavior in politics, in silicon valley, and in corporate america.', 'this is a big problem in our society, that people in power are taking advantage of people not in power—particularly powerful men with young women.', 'maybe cosby was the watershed moment.', 'i think roger ailes was also a watershed moment, because it concerned an establishment figure up to some very shady stuff.', 'but this isn’t a right or a left issue; this is a moral issue.', 'we’re all going to have to be more diligent about it and look for any warning signs.', 'before, people weren’t paying enough attention to it.', 'now we have to.', 'this is the moment to start scaring people like this into not acting

beginning of season six stating that one of the clear things she wanted to do was address immigration detention centers — that’s something she was adamant about, says chamberlayne of plotting the

impression on street that she remembered the meeting and later served as vonns mentor in skiing.', 'vonn commuted to colorado to train for several years before her family moved to vail, colorado in the late 1990s.', '[12][13]  vonn attended university of missouri high school, an online program through the universitys center for distance and independent study.', '[14][15] she speaks german

skills and to develop their comfort in the fall line (the most direct route down a ski slope), while ensuring the kids were exposed to as much terrain as possible versatility and exposure to diverse challenging terrain was the directive.', '[20][not in citation given] at that time, the gravity corps pre-age-class skiing program consisted of multiple groups of 8–10 skiers; it was the only scv

the answer was an emphatic no, lindsey was most definitely not a slow skier.', 'it was mentioned that if anyone ever said that lindsey was slow, it was likely because that person was not recognizing that lindsey was in a perpetual growth spurt and, that the person saying that lindsey was slow was not considering that changes in lindseys height, affected her center of gravity, etc., and skiing confidence, and thus that person who described lindsey as skiing slowly was not acknowledging the differences between a growing young male skier vs. a young female skier (who by the age of 11, stood at a much taller height than her peers) - which, in the scv gravity corps coachs opinion resulted in the devastatingly inaccurate slow comment.', 'the words used by colby s.scudder were more colorful,

investigation in 1999 found that the crash was caused by henri paul, who lost control of the mercedes at high speed while he was intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs.', 'paul was the deputy head of security at the hôtel ritz at the time of the crash and had goaded the paparazzi waiting outside the hotel earlier.', '[1] his inebriation may have been made worse by anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his body.', '[2][3] the investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the mercedes when it crashed.', '[4] after hearing evidence at the british inquest in 2008, a jury returned to a verdict of unlawful killing by paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car.', '[5]  dianas death caused a substantial outpouring of worldwide grief, including numerous floral tributes and her funeral was watched by an estimated 2 billion people.', 'the royal family were criticised in the press for their reaction to dianas death.', 'circumstances [

the son of mohamed al-fayed.', '[6] they had stopped there en route to london, having spent the preceding nine days together on board mohamed al-fayeds yacht jonikal on the french and italian riviera.', 'they had intended to stay there for the night.', 'mohamed al-fayed was and is the owner of the hôtel ritz paris.', 'he also owned an apartment in rue arsène houssaye, a short distance from the hotel, just off the avenue des champs elysées.', 'henri paul, the deputy head of security at the ritz hotel, had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 mercedes-benz s280 in order to elude the paparazzi;[9] a decoy vehicle left the ritz first from the main entrance on place vendôme, attracting a throng of photographers.', 'diana and fayed then departed from the hotels rear entrance,[10] rue cambon at around 00:20 on 31 august cest (22:20 on 30 august utc), heading for the apartment in rue arsène houssaye.', 'they did this to avoid the nearly 30 photographers waiting in the front of the hotel.', '[10] they were the rear passengers; trevor rees-jones, a member of the fayed familys personal protection team, was in the (right) front passenger seat.', 'it was believed that diana and dodi were not wearing seat belts.', '[12] after leaving the rue cambon and crossing the place de la concorde, they drove along cours la reine and cours albert 1er – the embankment road along the right bank of the river seine – into the place de lalma underpass.', '[13]  the crash [ edit ]  at 12:23 a.m., paul lost control of the vehicle at the entrance to the pont de lalma tunnel.', 'the car struck

speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).', '[15] it then spun and hit the stone wall of the tunnel backwards, finally coming to a stop.', 'the impact caused substantial damage, particularly to the front half of the vehicle, as there was no guard rail between the pillars to prevent this.', 'witnesses arriving shortly after the accident reported smoke.', '[17] witnesses also reported that photographers on motorcycles swarmed the mercedes sedan before it entered the tunnel.', '[12]  the aftermath [ edit ]  the entrance to the pont de lalma tunnel, the site where diana was fatally injured  as the victims lay in the wrecked car, the photographers, who had been driving slower and were accordingly some distance behind the mercedes, reached the scene.', 'the photographers were on motorcycles.', '[10] some rushed to help, tried to open the doors and help the victims, while some of them took pictures.', 'airbags were deployed.', '[19] police arrived on scene around 10 minutes after the crash at 00:30 and

diana was reported to murmur repeatedly, oh my god, and after the photographers and other helpers were pushed away by police, leave me alone.', '[23] in june 2007 the channel 4 documentary diana: the witnesses in the tunnel claimed that the first person to touch diana was dr. maillez,[24] who chanced upon the scene.', 'he reported that diana had no visible injuries but was in shock.', 'diana was removed from the car at 1:00 am.', 'she then went into cardiac arrest and following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again.', '[26] she was moved to the samu ambulance

dead.', '[28] paul was declared dead on removal from the wreckage.', 'both were taken to the institut médico-légal (iml), the paris mortuary, not to a hospital.', 'paul was later found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.175 grams per 100 ml of blood - about 3.5 times the legal limit in france.', '[21]  despite attempts to save her, dianas internal injuries were too extensive: her heart had been displaced to the right side of the chest, which tore the pulmonary vein and the pericardium.', 'despite lengthy resuscitation attempts, including internal cardiac massage, she died at 4:00 a.m.[31] anesthesiologist bruno riou announced her death at 6 am at a news conference held at the hospital.', '[17][32]  later that morning, jean-pierre chevènement (french minister of the interior) visited the hospital with french prime minister lionel jospin.', '[33] at around 5:00 pm, dianas former husband, charles, prince of wales, and her two older sisters, lady sarah mccorquodale and lady jane

pillar at 190 km/h (120 mph), and that the speedometers needle had jammed at that position.', '[21] it was later announced the cars speed on collision was about 95–110 km/h (60–70 mph).', 'the car was certainly travelling much faster than the speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph).', 'in 1999, a french investigation concluded the mercedes had come into contact with another vehicle (a white fiat uno) in the tunnel.', '[38] the driver of that vehicle has never been conclusively traced, although many believe the driver of the fiat was le van thanh but the specific vehicle has not been identified.', '[39] [38]  it was remarked by robin cook, the british foreign secretary, that if the accident had been caused in part by being hounded by paparazzi, that it would be doubly tragic.', '[10] dianas brother also blamed tabloid media for her death.', '[40] an 18-month french judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the crash was caused by paul, who lost control at high speed while intoxicated.', '[41]  mourning [ edit ]  members of the public were invited to sign a book of condolence at st. james palace.', '[42] all 11,000 light bulbs at harrods were turned off and not switched on again until after the funeral.', '[42] throughout the night, members of the womens royal voluntary service and the salvation army provided support for people queuing along the mall.', '[43] more than one million bouquets were left at her london home, kensington palace,[44] while at her familys estate of althorp the public was asked to stop bringing flowers as the volume of people and flowers in the surrounding roads was said to be causing a threat to public safety.', '[45]  by 10 september, the pile of flowers outside kensington gardens was 5 feet (1.5 m) deep in places and the bottom layer had started to compost.', '[46] the people were quiet, queuing patiently to sign the book and leave their gifts.', 'there were a few minor incidents.', 'fabio piras, a sardinian tourist, was given a one-week prison sentence on 10 september for having taken a teddy bear from the pile.', 'when the sentence was later reduced to a £100 fine, piras was punched in the face by a member of the public when he left the court.', '[47] the next day two slovakian tourists, maria rigolova, a 54-year-old secondary school teacher and agnese sihelksa, a 50-year-old communications technician, were each given a 28-day prison sentence for having taken 11 teddy bears and a number of flowers from the pile outside the palace.', '[48] this was reduced to a fine of £200 each.', '[49]  funeral [ edit ]  early on, it was uncertain if it would be a state funeral since diana had lost her royal status because of her divorce from prince charles in 1996.', '[50]  dianas death was met with extraordinary public expressions of grief, and her funeral at westminster abbey on 6 september drew an estimated 3 million mourners and onlookers in london,[51][52] and worldwide television coverage watched by 2.5 billion people.', '[53] it was aired to 200 countries in 44 languages.', '[54] outside the abbey and in hyde park crowds watched and listened to proceedings on large outdoor screens and speakers as guests filed in, including representatives of the many charities of which diana was patron.', 'attendants included us first lady hillary clinton, bernadette chirac, wife of the french president, jacques chirac and other celebrities, including italian tenor luciano pavarotti and friends of diana, george michael and elton john.', '[23][55] john performed a rewritten version of his song candle in the wind that was dedicated to her.', '[56] protocol was disregarded when the guests applauded the speech by dianas younger brother earl spencer, who strongly criticised the press and indirectly criticised the royal family for their treatment of her.', '[57] the funeral is estimated to have been watched by 31.5 million viewers in britain.', 'precise calculation of the worldwide audience is not possible, but estimated at around 2.5 billion.', '[58]  after the end of the ceremony, the coffin was driven to althorp in a daimler hearse.', '[59] mourners cast flowers at the funeral procession for almost the entire length of its journey and vehicles even stopped on the opposite carriageway of the m1 motorway as the cars passed.', '[60]  in a private ceremony, diana was buried on an island in the middle of a lake called the oval, which is part of the pleasure garden at althorp.', '[61] in her coffin, she wore a black catherine walker dress and is clutching a rosary in her hands.', 'the rosary had been a gift from mother teresa of calcutta, a confidante of diana, who had died the day before her funeral.', 'a visitors centre is open during summer months, with an exhibition about her and a walk around the lake.', 'all profits are donated to the diana, princess of wales memorial fund.', '[62]  reactions [ edit ]  some criticised the reaction to dianas death at the time as being hysterical and irrational.', 'as early as 1998 philosopher anthony ohear identified the mourning as a defining point in the sentimentalisation of britain, a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.', '[63] oasis bandleader noel gallagher responded to the reaction with the womans dead.', 'shut up.', 'get over it.', '[64] these criticisms were repeated on the 10th anniversary, when journalist jonathan freedland expressed the opinion that it has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary ... we cringe to think about it.', 'in 2010, theodore dalrymple suggested sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself.', '[65] some cultural analysts disagreed.', 'sociologist deborah steinberg pointed out that many britons associated diana not with the royal family but with social change and a more liberal society: i dont think it was hysteria, the loss of a public figure can be a touchstone for other issues.', '[66] carol wallace of people magazine said that the fascination with dianas death had to do with the fairy tale failing to end happily – twice, first when she got divorced and now that she died.', '[67]  royal family [ edit ]  the queen expressed her dismay at dianas death when she found out.', '[68] prince charles was the person who told their sons about their mothers death.', '[68] the princes were told of her death before dawn, as prince charles had to wake them up to share the tragic news.', '[69] the boys were close to their mother.', '[69] on sunday morning after dianas death, queen elizabeth, princes charles, william and harry all wore black to church services at balmoral castle.', '[70] prince charles, william and harry would be coming back to london on friday, september 5.', '[71] the queen, who returned to london from balmoral, agreed to a television broadcast to the nation.', '[72]  the royal family was criticised for a rigid adherence to protocol, and their concern to care for dianas grieving sons, was interpreted as a lack of compassion.', '[73] in particular, the refusal of buckingham palace to fly the royal standard at half-mast provoked angry headlines in newspapers.', '[73][74] where is our queen?', 'where is her flag?', 'asked the sun.', '[72] the palaces stance was one of royal protocol: no flag could fly over buckingham palace, as the royal standard is only flown when the queen is in residence, and the queen was then in scotland.', 'the royal standard never flies at half-mast as it is the sovereigns flag and there is never an interregnum or vacancy in the monarchy, as the new monarch immediately succeeds his or her predecessor.', 'finally, as a compromise, the union flag was flown at half-mast as the queen left for westminster abbey on the day of the funeral.', '[72] this set a precedent, and buckingham palace has subsequently flown the union flag when the queen is not in residence.', '[75] a rift between prince charles and the queens private secretary sir robert fellowes (dianas brother-in-law) was reported in the media over what the nature of the princesss funeral should be with charles demanding a public funeral and fellowes supporting the queens idea of a private one.', '[76] the palace later issued a statement denying such rumours.', '[76]  prince harry said in 2017 that the death of his mother caused severe depression and grief.', '[77] prince william was 15 and harry was 12 when diana died.', '[78]  politicians reactions [ edit ]

his wife, hillary clinton were profoundly saddened when they found out about her death.', '[17] kofi annan, the united nations secretary-general said that her death has robbed the world of a consistent and committed voice for the improvement of the lives of suffering children worldwide.', '[70] in australia, the deputy prime minister, tim fischer, condemned the paparazzi for their overzealous coverage of diana.', '[79] russian president boris yeltsin praised dianas charity work in a statement saying all know of princess dianas big contribution to charitable work, and not only in great britain.', '[80][81] among other politicians who sent messages of condolences were south african president nelson mandela, australian prime minister john howard, canadian prime minister jean chrétien, new zealand prime minister jim bolger, and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu.', '[80]  public reactions [ edit ]  in london, thousands of people carried bouquets and stood outside of buckingham palace after the news of her death.', '[70] people started bringing flowers within an hour after the news was shared.', '[68] the bbc flew its flags at half-mast.', '[70] both radio and television aired the british national anthem, god save the queen, in response to dianas death.', '[68]  people in the united states were shocked at her death.', '[82] in paris, thousands of people visited the site of the crash and the hospital where diana died.', '[83] people brought flowers and also attempted to visit the hotel ritz, as well.', '[83] in bosnia, a land-mine survivor, jasminko bjelic, who had met diana only three weeks earlier, said, she was our friend.', '[70] following her death many celebrities including actors and singers blamed the paparazzi and condemned their reckless behavior.', '[84][85]  during the four weeks following her funeral, the suicide rate in england and wales rose by 17% and cases of deliberate self-harm by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years.', 'researchers suggest that this was caused by the identification effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45%.', '[86] another research showed that 50% of britons and 27% of americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died.', 'it also concluded that in general women were more affected than men in both of the countries.', '[87] the same research showed that dianas charitable endeavors and ability to identify with ordinary people were among the main factors that caused her to be admired and respected by the people.', '[87] in the weeks after her death counselling services reported an increase in the number of phone calls by the people who were seeking help due to grief or distress.', '[88]  the national grieving for diana had economic effects.', 'in the short term, the centre for economics and business research (cebr) estimated that retail sales dropped 1% that week.', 'traffic congestion in central london as crowds went to the palaces to pay homage likewise adversely affected productivity, and the cebr estimated that would cost businesses £200 million, or a total loss of 0.1% of gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1997. however, in the long run the cebr expected that to be offset by increased tourism and memorabilia sales.', '[89]  memorials [ edit ]  flame of liberty, the unofficial diana memorial in paris, france the, the unofficial diana memorial in paris, france  in the years

asked the metropolitan police commissioner, sir john stevens, to make inquiries, in response to speculation that the deaths were not an accident.', '[92][94] the police investigation reported its findings in operation paget in december 2006.', '[95]  in january 2006, lord stevens explained in an interview on gmtv that the case is substantially more complex than once thought.', 'the sunday times wrote on 29 january 2006 that agents of the british secret service were cross-examined because they were in paris at the time of the crash.', 'it was suggested in many journals that these agents might have exchanged the blood test of the driver with another blood sample (although no evidence for this has been forthcoming).', '[96][97]  the inquests into the deaths of diana and fayed opened on 8 january 2007, with dame elizabeth butler-sloss acting as deputy coroner of the queens household for the diana inquest and assistant deputy coroner for surrey in relation to the fayed inquest.', 'butler-sloss originally intended to sit without a jury;[98] this decision was later overturned by the high court,[99] as well as the jurisdiction of the coroner of the queens household.', 'on 24 april 2007, butler-sloss stepped down, saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury.', '[100] the role of coroner for the inquests was transferred to lord justice scott baker, who formally took up the role on 13 june as coroner for inner west london.', '[101]  on 27 july 2007, baker, following representations for the lawyers of the interested parties, issued a list of issues likely to be raised at the inquest, many of which had been dealt with in great detail by operation paget:  whether driver error on the part of henri paul caused or contributed to the cause of the collision whether henri pauls ability to drive was impaired through drink or drugs whether a fiat uno or any other vehicle caused or contributed to the collision whether the actions of the paparazzi caused or contributed to the cause of the collision whether the road/tunnel layout and construction were inherently dangerous and, if so, whether this contributed to the collision

correspondence belonging to the princess of wales (including some from prince philip) has disappeared, and if so the circumstances.', '[102]  the inquests officially began on 2 october 2007 with the swearing of a jury of six women and five men.', 'scott baker delivered a lengthy opening statement giving general instructions to the jury and introducing the evidence.', '[103] the bbc reported that mohamed al-fayed, having earlier reiterated his claim that his son and diana were murdered by the royal family, immediately criticised the opening statement as biased.', '[104]  the inquest heard evidence from people connected with diana and the events leading to her death, including paul burrell, mohamed al-fayed, her stepmother, the survivor of the crash, and the former head of mi5.', '[105]  scott baker began his summing up to the jury on 31 march 2008.', '[106] he opened by telling the jury no-one except you and i and, i think, the gentleman in the public gallery with diana and fayed painted on his forehead sat through every word of evidence and concluded that there was not a shred of evidence that dianas death had been ordered by the duke of edinburgh or organised by the security services.', '[107] lord justice scott baker concluded his summing up on wednesday, 2 april 2008.', '[108] after summing up, the jury retired to consider five verdicts, namely unlawful killing by the negligence of either or both the following vehicles or paul; accidental death or an open verdict.', '[106] the jury decided on 7 april 2008 that diana had been unlawfully killed by the following vehicles.', '[109][110] princes william and harry released a statement in which they said that they agree with their verdicts and are both hugely grateful.', '[111] mohamed al fayed also said that he would accept the verdict and abandon his 10-year campaign to prove that diana and dodi were murdered in a conspiracy.', '[112]  the cost of the inquiry exceeded £12.5 million, with the coroners

found that diana had died as a result of an accident, several conspiracy theories have been raised.', '[116] since february 1998, fayeds father, mohamed al-fayed (the owner of the hôtel ritz, where paul worked, and thus potentially liable for wrongful death liability) has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,[117] and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by mi6 on the instructions of the royal family.', '[118] his claims were dismissed by a french judicial investigation[2] and by operation paget, a metropolitan police service inquiry that concluded in 2006.', '[119] an inquest headed by lord justice scott baker into the deaths of diana and fayed began at the royal courts of justice, london, on 2 october 2007, a continuation of the inquest that began in 2004.', '[100] on 7 april 2008, the jury concluded that diana and fayed were the victims of an unlawful killing by the grossly negligent chauffeur paul and the drivers of the following vehicles.', '[120] additional factors were the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the mercedes through alcohol and the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the mercedes struck the pillar in the alma tunnel rather than colliding with something else.', '[109]  on 17 august 2013, scotland yard revealed that they were

100 years.', '[124] historian nick barrett criticised this outcome as being a pretty shocking result.', '[125]  later in 2004, us tv network cbs showed pictures of the crash scene in one of its programmes which were part of a 4,000-page french government report.', 'it showed an intact rear side and centre section of the mercedes, including one of an unbloodied diana with no outward injuries crouched on the rear floor with her back to the right passenger seat—the right rear door is fully open.', 'the release of these pictures were poorly received in the uk, where it was felt that the privacy of diana was being infringed.', '[126] buckingham palace, uk prime minister and dianas brother condemned the action, while cbs defended its decision saying that the pictures are placed in journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given to princess diana just after the crash.', '[127]  on 13 july 2006, italian magazine chi published photographs that showed diana amid the wreckage of the car crash;[128] the photos were released despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published.', '[129][b] the editor of chi defended his decision by saying he published the photographs simply because they had not been previously seen, and he felt the images were not disrespectful to the memory of diana.', '[129]  the british newspaper the daily express has been criticised for continued and sustained coverage of princess diana following her death.', 'a 2006 report in the guardian showed that the newspaper had mentioned her in numerous recent news stories, with headlines including perhaps diana should have worn seatbelt, diana inquiry chiefs laptop secrets stolen, £250,000 a year bill to run diana fountain and diana seatbelt sabotage probe.',

originating on the planet gallifrey.', 'this process allows a time lord to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality after instances which would normally result in death.', 'regeneration has been used twelve times throughout the history of the franchise as a device for introducing a new actor for the lead role of its main character, the doctor.', 'other time lords and similar characters have also regenerated, usually for narrative, rather than casting, reasons.', 'the current incarnation of the doctor is played by jodie whittaker, following the regeneration of the twelfth doctor (portrayed by peter capaldi) during the 2017 christmas special twice upon a time.', 'conceptual history [ edit ]  inspiration [ edit ]  the concept of regeneration was created in 1966 by the writers of doctor who as a method of replacing the leading actor.', 'the role of the doctor had been played by william hartnell since the programme began in 1963 but, by 1966, it was increasingly apparent that hartnells health was deteriorating and he was becoming more difficult to work with.', 'producer john wiles had, following several clashes with hartnell, intended to have the actor replaced in the celestial toymaker; during two episodes of that serial, the doctor is invisible (owing to hartnell being on holiday during the recording).', 'wiles plan was for the character to reappear played by a new actor.', 'this proposal was vetoed by gerald savory, the bbcs head of serials (and wiles superior), which led to wiles leaving before the celestial toymaker was produced.', '[1] however, it was apparent that it would not be possible for hartnell to continue for much longer.', 'on 29 july 1966, production concluded on the final episode of the smugglers, the last serial recorded in the third production block.', '[citation needed] during production, hartnell and producer innes lloyd had reached an agreement that he should leave the role, having starred in one more serial that would see a handover to a new actor, which would be the first one produced as part of season 4. script editor gerry davis proposed that, since the doctor had already been established as an alien, the character could die and return in a new body.', 'lloyd took this further by suggesting that the doctor could do this renewal regularly, transforming from an older man to a younger one; this would allow for the convenient recasting of the role when necessary.', '[citation needed] the process itself was modelled on lsd trips, with the experience being like the hell and dank horror of taking the drug.', '[2]  at the conclusion of the tenth planet, the first doctor collapses from apparent old age and exhaustion, having commented earlier that his body was wearing a bit thin.', 'then, before the eyes of his companions ben and polly, and of the viewing audience, his features shift into that of the second doctor, played by patrick troughton.', 'in the power of the daleks, the second doctors first story, the doctor draws an analogy between the renewal and a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.', '[3]  developing the concept [ edit ]  it was not clear initially whether the renewal was a natural ability of the doctors as opposed to a process initiated by technology.', 'in power of the daleks, the second doctor describes his renewal as a function of his tardis time machine, stating that without it, [he] couldnt survive.', '[3]  when troughton left the series in 1969, the doctor was renewed again, but this time the change was forced on him by the time lords at the conclusion of the war games, where it is referred to as a change of appearance.', 'as with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although jon pertwees portrayal of the third doctor also differed quite substantially from troughtons.', 'unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in the war games the doctor protests, you cant just change what i look like without consulting me!', 'as the series continued, more aspects of the regenerative process were introduced, but the basic concepts of regeneration as accepted by fans of the series today were only firmly established in the final scene of planet of the spiders (1974), when pertwees third doctor turns into tom bakers fourth doctor.', 'in this scene, the change is called regeneration for the first time, and is explained as a biological process that occurs when a time lords body is dying.', 'it is also stated that following the regeneration the doctors brain cells would be shaken up and his behaviour would be erratic for a time, something that would be evident for most subsequent regenerations.', 'in the about time reference series lawrence miles and tat wood note that the officially licensed magazine, doctor who monthly, stated in a matrix data-bank column in 1982 that its readers should not confuse the regenerations of later incarnations with the rejuvenation of hartnell into troughton.', '[4] however, dialogue within the series itself explicitly includes the first-to-second rejuvenation when enumerating the doctors regenerations (for example in mawdryn undead (1983)).', 'transitions [ edit ]  logopolis, 1981, and castrovalva, 1982) the fourth doctor regenerates into the fifth doctor (from, 1981, and, 1982)  the regeneration effect was accomplished during the series original run from 1963–1989 primarily through the use of video mixing.', 'originally, the plan was to have hartnell collapse at the end of the tenth planet with his cloak over his face, which would then be pulled back to reveal troughton in the next serial.', 'however, vision mixer shirley coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed hartnells image to be overexposed to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading back in to reveal troughtons face.', 'this also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of the tenth planet, and troughton was accordingly signed up to participate.', '[citation needed]  subsequent regenerations retained essentially the same method, with or without additional video or make-up effects.', 'the transition from the fourth to the fifth doctor used an additional make-up effect representing a transitional form known as the watcher, but aside from this, other regenerations in the original series run simply mixed the image of the

which the doctor has regenerated outside the tardis: one is forced on him by the time lords (second to third doctor, the war games); one requires a time lord to give the doctors cells a little push to start the process (third to fourth, planet of the spiders); one results in his being dependent on the tardiss zero room, a chamber sealed from all outside forces, to help him recover (fourth to fifth, castrovalva); one occurs a few hours after he has actually died (seventh to eighth, the 1996 television film; the delay at is, however, shown to have been caused by anaesthetic, rather than the doctors distance from the tardis); one is induced by the sisterhood of karn after reviving the doctor from actual death (eighth doctor, the night of the doctor).', 'the seventh to eighth regeneration

doctor, eliciting a response from him.', 'energy release and increased strength [ edit ]  the exact mechanism that makes regeneration possible is not stated in the television series, but it is generally assumed in the spin-off media that the ability to regenerate may be linked to what is known as the rassilon imprimatur, the symbiotic nuclei of a time lord that bonds him or her to a tardis, and allows his or her body to withstand the molecular stresses of time travel (the two doctors, 1985).', '[note 1]  in the christmas invasion (2005) it is stated that the regenerative cycle generates a large amount of energy that suffuses the time lords body, and also shown that residual effects from a regeneration allow him to grow back a hand within the first 15 hours after the initial start of the regeneration.', 'accordingly, in lets kill hitler, river song is able to repel bullets after regenerating.', 'she is later able to send off an energy wave soon after her regeneration, though this

incarnation, the doctor possessed enough physical strength to batter a steel door completely off its hinges.', 'in twice upon a time, the first doctors dying of old age had earlier rendered him weak

out energy blasts that obliterate nearby daleks and an entire dalek saucer.', 'the release of energy also causes a shockwave that severely damages the town where the regeneration took place.', 'the twelfth doctors regeneration into the thirteenth is also quite explosive; while the streams of regeneration energy being emitted from the doctor cause some minor damage to the console room, the full extent is revealed when it begins to explode immediately after the doctor attempts to operate it, and she ends up falling from the tardis.', 'personality change [ edit ]  with regeneration also comes a change of personality.', 'the viewing audience sees this most often and most dramatically in the differing quirks and personality traits of the doctors various incarnations.', 'the doctors core personality traits of heroism and intolerance of injustice are still retained, but in the end of time the tenth doctor laments that demise of his current incarnation, with its own personality and attributes, makes for something much akin to an actual death.', 'his last words before regenerating are i dont want to go.', 'shortly after the regeneration process, the doctor sometimes goes through a period of physical and psychological instability.', 'the fourth doctor described it as a new body is like a new house - takes a little bit of time to settle in.', 'the second doctor experiences crippling pain after his first regeneration (in the power of the daleks), while the third doctor collapses outside the tardis following his regeneration (in spearhead from space).', 'the fourth doctor

previous personalities, and the sixth doctor experiences extreme paranoia, flying into a murderous rage and nearly killing his companion (the twin dilemma, 1984).', 'the eighth doctor experienced amnesia as a result of post-regeneration trauma (the 1996 television film); uniquely, the doctor was not alive at the time of this regeneration.', 'the regeneration from the ninth to the tenth doctor sees the doctor experiencing sudden spasms and great pain (children in need special), and later being unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours (the christmas invasion).', 'the regeneration from the tenth to the eleventh doctor caused the doctor to experience strange food cravings, only to be disgusted by them upon actually trying them (the eleventh hour).', 'the twelfth doctor forgot how to fly the tardis (as well as the name of the tardis) right after the regeneration process in the time of the doctor.', 'the brain of morbius implies that time lords other than the doctor may experience difficult regenerations, since the sisterhood of karn had been supplying them with an elixir of life that could assist the process.', 'in the night of the doctor, the sisterhood tell the eighth doctor they can provide elixirs to give rise to non-random regenerations, allowing the doctor to specify either a physical type or personality.', 'the master showed a dramatic personality change upon regenerating into the mistress/missy.', 'in that form, she wants nothing more than to renew her bond with the doctor, even calling him her boyfriend at one point.', '(deep breath, death in heaven) when she met him again, missy pretended to be an android and kissed him passionately.', '(dark water) despite still being manic and a psychopath, she later showed a willingness to reform, spending centuries in the doctors custody as a show of her commitment.', 'later, she felt torn between the doctor, who represented her repentance, and her past incarnation, who represented a return to her old ways; she ultimately chose the doctor, for which her past incarnation killed her in disgust.', 'in turn, though missy expressed a love for who she was in her past incarnation, she forced his own

in need special, which takes place immediately after that episode, the newly regenerated tenth doctor, while examining his new body, makes a point of checking that he has two arms, two legs and two hands, implying that regenerations can sometimes result in physically deformed or non-humanoid forms; it is not clear whether or not these two moments are intended as jokes.', 'the beginning of

male title.', 'from twice upon a time onward, jodie whittaker portrays the thirteenth doctor, the doctors first female incarnation.', 'female doctors were previously explored in spin-off productions;

tv series.', 'for example, in the big finish productions audio circular time, a time lord known as cardinal zero regenerates into an avian life-form after being poisoned.', '[11]  control over regeneration [ edit ]  the doctors regenerations are always involuntary, and he has no control over his final appearance.', 'in the parting of the ways (2005), the ninth doctor describes the process as a bit dodgy—i.e., somewhat dangerous or uncertain—and the tenth doctor refers to regeneration as a lottery (the day of the doctor, 2013).', 'for example, despite an apparent wish for this to occur, neither the tenth nor the eleventh doctors regenerated into redheads.', 'the sole known exception to this is the eighth doctors regeneration into the war doctor (the night of the doctor, 2013), as the

several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of princess astra, a person she encountered in a previous adventure (the armageddon factor).', 'many writers of spin-off media have attempted to rationalise the difference between the doctors and romanas regenerations.', 'doctor who television writer and script editor eric saward suggests in his 1985 novelisation of the twin

its early stages.', '[13]  other moments in the series suggest that other time lords have more control over their regeneration than that usually displayed by the doctor.', 'prior to regenerating in

the doctor in his fourth incarnation, and once he has, it then takes him a while to realise that his appearance has changed.', 'however, in the armageddon factor (1978), drax, another old classmate,

predestination paradox to cancel out a universe-destroying black hole with a supernova by blowing up the tardis.', 'when the tenth and the eleventh doctor meet each other in the day of the doctor, the

through his past incarnations, as seen in earthshock and the next doctor.', 'in utopia, while the master was under the chameleon arch, the doctor could not sense that he was a time lord.', 'after the masters personality reasserted itself, the doctor instantly sensed him and could tell which time lord it was without being told.', 'in the sound of drums, the doctor stated that he would be able to recognize the regenerated master on sight despite having never seen his new incarnation, claiming that time lords could always recognize each other.', 'due to the masters archangel network, the doctors ability to sense another time lord had been blocked up to that point.', 'during the end of time, the master and the doctor could sense each others presence when in proximity, with both appearing to sniff each other out.', 'however, this ability has a limited range as stated by the doctor to wilfred mott.', 'while he could sense that the master was still on earth, he could not tell where he was as the master was too far away to track precisely.', 'in dark water, the doctor failed to recognize that missy was a regeneration of the master, and may not have been able to tell that she was a time lord at all until she revealed her identity to him.', 'in world enough and time, the disguised master figured out that missy was his own future self, but this was due to deduction from

that reinvigorates, rather than transforms, the subjects appearance (in this case, the minyans, with whom the time lords shared much of their technology), thereby regenerating the body, not the soul.', 'failed/fake regeneration [ edit ]  it has been suggested in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail.', 'after his cellular structure is decimated by the metabelis crystals in planet of the spiders, the third doctors regeneration requires a little push from fellow time lord kanpo rimpoche before it can proceed.', 'as he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in the caves of androzani, the fifth doctor says, i might regenerate... i dont know... it feels different this time... is this death?', 'he then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die.', 'the 1996 tv movie showed the doctors regeneration delayed for more than three hours, with the eighth doctor later remarking that the fact his seventh incarnation was under anaesthesia at the time of his death could have destroyed the regenerative process, and that he was dead too long this time prior to his regeneration.', 'in many episodes, the doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation.', '(the only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios – in the end of time – he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and a new man walks away).', 'in the mind of evil the master points a conventional firearm at the doctor and threatens to put a bullet through both [his] hearts, while in forest of the dead, professor song warns that electrocution would stop both the time lords hearts, killing him.', 'in turn left, in which the tenth doctor dies in a parallel world, a unit member speculates that what happened to the doctor must have happened too fast for him to regenerate (it is suggested that he drowned without his future companion donna noble there to inspire him to leave).', 'in the end of time, the doctor explains to wilfred mott that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail.', 'in the series 6 premiere, the impossible astronaut, a future version of the eleventh doctor is shot twice by the titular astronaut and begins to regenerate.', 'however he is then shot again and dies, showing that not only can he be killed before regeneration, but also during the process (however, the later revelation, in the wedding of river song that what was shot was in fact a mechanical avatar of the doctor and not the real person calls this into question).', 'in the episode lets kill hitler, the doctor is poisoned by river song which disables the ability to regenerate and he seemingly dies, although he is later revived when river gives up her remaining regenerations to save him.', 'the time of the doctor later shows that the doctor did not have any remaining regenerations at this time anyway.', 'in the mini-episode the night of the doctor, the eighth doctor is killed when the ship he is on crashes onto the planet karn, reinforcing the idea that a sudden, traumatic death may prevent regeneration.', 'the sisterhood of karn explain that he was, in fact, dead, but they were able to use their time lord-based technology to revive him and force a regeneration anyway.', 'in heaven sent, the twelfth doctor is badly burned by the veil, preventing him from regenerating properly.', 'however, as his island prison resets itself after leaving a room, he used what was left of his life to download a past version of himself out of the teleporters hard drive, which also reset.', 'this cycle of bringing himself back to life by burning his current body as energy for the process continued for approximately 4.5 billion years, according to the episode hell bent.', 'in the lie of the land, the twelfth doctor fakes a regeneration after his companion bill potts shoots him after he pretends to be siding with the monks.', 'the bullets that are fired are revealed to have been blanks, and the whole thing was a test by the doctor to see if bill was under the monks influence.', 'transference of regenerative energy [ edit ]  in mawdryn undead, it is first stated that a time lord can transfer his regenerative life essence to another being.', 'in that story, the fifth doctor is coerced by mawdryn to give up his future regenerations in order to cure nyssa and tegan jovanka from mawdryns disease.', 'although the transfer does not occur (due to the timely interference of brigadier lethbridge-stewart), the doctor states that the consequence of the transference would be that he would sacrifice his eight remaining lives and cease to be a time lord.', 'it is not until lets kill hitler that a similar transference is shown; in that instance, river song sacrifices her own regenerative power in order to revive the dead eleventh doctor.', 'the favour is returned in the angels take manhattan in which rivers wrist is repaired by the doctor, who subsequently gives up a portion of his regenerative energy despite it later being revealed that the doctor is out of regenerations at that point.', 'a major plot point of the 1996 tv movie involves the master scheming to steal the doctors remaining regenerations for himself.', 'the tenth doctor also consciously aborts a regeneration in journeys end and instead transfers the energy to his previously severed hand (from the christmas invasion), which had been saved in a container by captain jack harkness; when donna noble touches it, it creates an entirely new person - a meta-crisis half-human doctor.', 'the eleventh doctor confirms, before himself regenerating during the events of the time of the doctor, that this action used up a full regeneration.', 'in the witchs familiar, the twelfth doctor offers a small amount of regenerative energy to dalek creator davros to sustain him in his dying minutes a bit longer.', 'the doctor says that doing so may cost [him] an arm or a leg down the road.', 'davros, however, siphons off much more regeneration energy from the doctor to revitalize himself and transform the daleks on skaro into superior hybrid creatures.', 'his plan backfires when decaying daleks—incapable of dying, and kept in an underground sewer system when their effective lives have expired—are also reenergized and attack the daleks on the surface.', 'the doctor reveals that he expected such a plot and knew it would backfire.', 'regenerations depicted in the series [ edit ]  the doctors regenerations [ edit ]  the tenth doctors fiery regeneration into the eleventh doctor.', 'romanas regenerations [ edit ]  romanas tongue-in-cheek regeneration scene in destiny of the daleks (1979) contrasts markedly with the doctors transformations.', 'in the first episode of the serial, romana undergoes regeneration, in the process trying out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of princess astra, a character she encountered in a previous adventure (the armageddon factor).', 'multiple attempts have been made in the spin-off media to explain the necessity for romanas regeneration.', 'the masters regenerations [ edit ]  the master has only been shown to regenerate once onscreen.', 'however, the master does change appearance several times, often circumventing the limitations ordinarily placed upon time lords.', 'originally played by roger delgado, his decrepit later appearance (following delgados death) in the deadly assassin (1976) is explained as owing to the fact that he is in his final regeneration.', 'he is driven to acquire a new regeneration cycle, but is ultimately able to circumvent the end of his life by possessing the body of tremas (antony ainley) in the keeper of traken (1981).', 'ainley portrays the master until the conclusion of the classic series, although still plots at several times to obtain a new regeneration cycle.', 'in the 1996 tv movie, the master is executed but cheats death by possessing a parasitic creature, which in turn possesses a human named bruce (eric roberts), giving the master another new form.', 'when the master is reintroduced in 2007, exposition explains he was resurrected by the time lords to fight in the time war, apparently with a new regeneration cycle.', 'in utopia (2007), he is fatally shot by his assistant and changes from a form known as professor yana, played by derek jacobi, into a new incarnation, played by john simm.', 'before regenerating, the master expresses desire to become young and strong like the tenth doctor.', 'a character named missy first appears in deep breath (2014) before being revealed as the master in dark water (2014), having regenerated off-screen during the characters absence.', 'for most of missys appearances, it is unknown how the master regenerated into her.', 'it is later revealed in the doctor falls that it was missy herself who forced the regeneration.', 'in an effort to ensure that she would come into existence and stand with the doctor, missy stabbed the master in the back to trigger his regeneration, but made the wound precise so that he would have time to reach his tardis before the regeneration began.', 'in return, the master killed missy with his laser screwdriver and stated that hed disabled her regeneration so that she would die permanently of the shot.', 'though the masters regeneration into missy was left inevitable, it was not shown on-screen.', 'in several of the short stories published in the doctor who universe, some regenerations for the master are seen including two separate reasons for the roger delgado incarnations regeneration.', 'in the short story pandorics box, the master is depicted as regenerating into missy due to his battle with rassilon who also regenerated as predicted by the moment.', 'however, this is contradicted by world enough and time and the doctor falls.', 'river songs regenerations [ edit ]  river song, also known as melody pond has regenerated twice throughout the course of the sixth series.', 'although she is human and the daughter of amy pond (hence her surname) and rory williams, she was conceived on their wedding night aboard the tardis and therefore was born with genetic traits similar to the doctors own race, the time lords.', 'in day of the moon (2011), melody pond as a child (sydney wade) walks through a new york city alley at the end of the episode in early 1970, suffering from an unknown illness.', 'when a vagrant asks of her condition, she explains that all is well, that she is dying, but she can fix it.', 'she subsequently begins to regenerate in the style of the revived series as the vagrant flees in terror.', 'in lets kill hitler, it is revealed that she regenerated into a toddler (maya glace-green).', 'this form later matured into amy ponds best friend, mels (nina toussaint-white), who regenerated into her more widely known river song (alex kingston) identity after being shot.', 'in the aforementioned episode, post-regeneration, melody is immune to a barrage of gunfire due to her surplus regenerative energy.', 'in that same episode, river song used all her remaining regeneration energy to revive the doctor; as amy put it youre safe now.', 'apparently you used all your remaining regenerations in one go.', 'you shouldnt have done that.', 'she was hospitalised as a result and now no-longer possesses the ability to regenerate.', 'in the husbands of river song, its revealed that river possesses an augmented lifespan in her final incarnation, but its never made clear if this is a side-effect of her part-time lord physiology or something she obtained from other means.', 'other regenerations [ edit ]  in hell bent (2015), while threatened with a gun, the general states to the doctor that he is currently in his tenth regeneration.', 'the doctor then shoots him, causing him to regenerate from an old white man into a younger black woman.', 'the general later states that her previous incarnation was her only one as a male.', 'in the doctors daughter (2008), the doctors dna is used to create the titular daughter jenny (georgia moffett), who displays many but not all time lord traits.', 'in the episodes close, she is shot in the chest and appears to die.', 'however, long after the doctor and his companions have departed, she miraculously resurrects and expels energy from her mouth which, ambiguously enough, both resembles regenerative energy and the energy emitted by a planet-restoring plot device in the same episode.', 'the question as to whether this is a true regeneration is left unanswered, since jenny does not change her appearance.', 'in the end of time (2009/2010), the master attacks the lord president rassilon with energy bolts, bringing rassilon to his knees.', 'by the time of his next appearance in hell bent, rassilon has regenerated into a much older incarnation.', 'in the short story pandorics box, its confirmed that the masters attack prompted this regeneration as predicted by the moment.', 'in the premiere of the 2009 spin-off series k-9, the original k-9 mark i (leeson) is reintroduced and destroyed, but subsequently revealed to have been installed with a regeneration circuit.', 'at this point, the traditional k-9 model regenerates into a more sophisticated-looking cgi model.', 'visual effects [ edit ]  each new regeneration was also radically different from the previous one, even in terms of the visual effects used to represent the moment of regeneration.', 'the very first regeneration was devised and executed by vision mixer shirley coward, who had rather unexpectedly come up with a method of achieving the effect electronically.', 'the original plan of the production team was simply that william hartnell would fall to the floor at the end of the tenth planet and pull his cape over his face.', 'troughton would then appear at the top of the power of the daleks, retracting the cloak.', 'cowards then-innovative vision mix necessitated that troughton be hastily contracted for the tenth planet, part four.', 'the series first regeneration sequence was then duly recorded on 8 october 1966, with the cliffhanger resolution filmed two weeks later on 22 october.', '(ref: the second doctor handbook) older portrayals of regenerations were either a simple fade between two incarnations, a glowing effect that revealed the next incarnation, or one incarnation morphing into the next.', 'each subsequent regeneration was then filmed in a variety of different ways, as dictated by the director on that particular episode.', 'indeed, no two regenerations were particularly similar until the russell t davies era.', 'only bbc wales doctor who attempted to standardise the way regeneration looked.', 'ever since the parting of the ways (2005), every regeneration has been portrayed as a golden glow explosion (although the colour of the explosion is fiery orange in the parting of the ways and is milky white in utopia).', 'rose was the first to describe this type of regenerations, saying i saw him sort of explode, and then you replaced him to the tenth doctor immediately after the ninth doctor regenerated.', 'also, these regenerations are portrayed as violent discharges that could harm anyone nearby, to the point where the most powerful occurrences, seen in the end of time and the time of the doctor, were able to destroy the tardis interior and send out a shockwave that destroyed a dalek ship along with several troops respectively.', 'each time there was a regeneration with people nearby, either the doctor or his companions had everyone present get away from the person who was regenerating to avoid them being harmed.', 'in smaller discharges, regeneration was far less harmful and could be emitted from the hand in wisps of golden regeneration energy, which was capable of healing the injuries of others.', 'the subsequent children in need special established that there was residual regeneration energy in a gaseous state after a transformation which had to be expelled through the mouth.', 'this was seen again in the christmas invasion, the eleventh hour and the doctors daughter — though the latter narrative never made quite clear that jenny actually regenerated.', 'the tenth doctor was seen breathing out gaseous regeneration energy shortly after his transformation, as was the eleventh doctor.', 'consciously holding back the regeneration caused a buildup of energy that resulted in a powerful and violent explosive discharge of regeneration energy.', 'also, gaining a new cycle of regenerations and time lords lives being reset resulted in a shockwave and explosion of regeneration energy with the range of a thermonuclear explosion.', 'directed regeneration energy discharges could destroy anything in its path, even a dalek saucer, while the shock wave destroyed any dalek troops in the vicinity.', 'the actual regeneration of the eleventh doctor, following the wild outburst of regeneration energy that only reset his body, is the first time that the revived series differed from the established process of regeneration.', 'when regenerating into the twelfth doctor, the process only includes a brief, mostly off-screen (due to the doctor leaning back out of the camera) blast of energy.', 'this visual standardisation has allowed narratives to play around with regeneration.', 'the mere presence of regeneration energy can now be used to heighten dramatic tension.', 'this visual short cut, unavailable to production teams in the classic era, has been a particular favourite of steven moffat, who used the golden glow liberally throughout the 2011 series; in fact, unlike in the russell t davies era, in which nearly every regeneration had subtle differences, every moffat era regeneration until the time of the doctor is nearly identical.', 'several of the 2011 episodes used that vfx in a way that wordlessly suggested regeneration.', 'see also
