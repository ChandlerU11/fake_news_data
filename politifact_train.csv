well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journeys end is near.', 'helvering v. davis, supra, at 641. but the practical effectuation of that judgment has of necessity called forth a highly complex and interrelated statutory structure.', 'integrated treatment of the manifold specific problems presented by the social security program demands more than a generalization.',

davis, supra, at 644. particularly when we deal with a withholding of a noncontractual benefit under a social welfare program such as this, we must recognize that the due process clause can be thought to interpose a bar only if the statute manifests a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification.', 'such is not the case here.', 'the fact of a beneficiarys residence abroad - in the case of a deportee, a presumably permanent residence - can be of obvious relevance to the question of eligibility.', 'one benefit which may be thought to accrue to the economy from the social security system is the increased over-all national purchasing power resulting from taxation of productive elements of the economy to provide payments to the retired and disabled, who might otherwise be destitute or nearly so, and who would generally spend a comparatively large percentage of their benefit payments.', 'this advantage would be lost as to payments made to one residing

of these contentions is the validity of characterizing as punishment in the constitutional sense the termination of benefits under sec.', '202(n).', 'in determining whether legislation which bases a disqualification on the happening of a certain past event imposes a punishment, the court has sought to discern the objects on which the enactment in question was focused.', 'where the source of legislative concern can be thought to be the activity or status from which the individual is barred, the disqualification is not punishment even though it may bear harshly upon one affected.', 'the contrary is the case where the statute in question is evidently aimed at the person or class of persons disqualified.', 'in the earliest case on which appellee relies, a clergyman successfully challenged a state constitutional provision barring from that profession - and from many other professions and offices - all who would not swear that they had never manifested any sympathy or support for the cause of the confederacy.', 'cummings v. missouri, supra.', 'the court thus described the aims of the challenged enactment: the oath could not ... have been required as a means of ascertaining whether parties were qualified or not for their respective callings or the trusts with which they were charged.', 'it was required in order to reach the person, not the calling.', 'it was exacted, not from any notion that the several acts designated indicated unfitness for the callings, but because it was thought that the several acts deserved punishment ... .', 'id., at 320. only the other day the governing inquiry was stated, in an opinion joined by four members of the court, in these terms: the question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct, is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation, such as the proper qualifications for a profession.', 'de veau v. braisted, 363 u.s. 144, 160 (plurality opinion).', 'in ex parte garland, supra, where the court struck down an oath - similar in content to that involved in cummings - required of attorneys seeking to practice before any federal court, as also in cummings, the finding of punitive intent drew heavily on the courts first-hand acquaintance with the events and the mood of the then recent civil war, and the fierce passions which that struggle aroused.', 'cummings v. missouri, supra, at 322.', '(fn8) similarly, in united states v. lovett, supra, where the court invalidated, as a bill of attainder, a statute forbidding - subject to certain conditions - the further payment of the salaries of three named government employees, the determination that a punishment had been imposed rested in large measure on the specific congressional history which the court was at pains to spell out in detail.', 'see 328 u.s., at 308-312. most recently, in trop v. dulles, 356 u.s. 86, which held unconstitutional a statute providing for the expatriation of one who had been sentenced by a court-martial to dismissal or dishonorable discharge for wartime desertion, the majority of the court characterized the statute as punitive.', 'however, no single opinion commanded the support of a majority.', 'the plurality opinion rested its determination, at least in part, on its inability to discern any alternative purpose which the statute could be thought to serve.', 'id., at 97. the concurring opinion found in the specific historical evolution of the provision in question compelling evidence of punitive intent.', 'id., at 107-109. it is thus apparent that, though the governing criterion may be readily stated, each case has turned on its own highly particularized context.', 'where no persuasive showing of a purpose to reach the person, not the calling, cummings v. missouri, supra, at 320, has been made, the court has not hampered legislative regulation of activities within its sphere of concern, despite the often-severe effects such regulation has had on the persons subject to it.', '(fn9) thus, deportation has been held to be not punishment, but an exercise of the plenary power of congress to fix the conditions under which aliens are to be permitted to enter and remain in this country.', 'fong yue ting v. united states, 149 u.s. 698, 730; see galvan v. press, 347 u.s. 522, 530-531. similarly, the setting by a state of qualifications for the practice of medicine, and their modification from time to time, is an incident of the states power to protect the health and safety of its citizens, and its decision to bar from practice persons who commit or have committed a felony is taken as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power, and not a purpose to add to the punishment of ex felons.', 'hawker v. new york, 170 u.s. 189. see de veau v. braisted, supra (regulation of crime on the waterfront through disqualification of ex-felons from holding union office).', 'cf.', 'helvering v. mitchell, 303 u.s. 391, 397-401, holding that, with respect to deficiencies due to fraud, a 50 percent addition to the tax imposed was not punishment so as to prevent, upon principles of double jeopardy, its assessment against one acquitted of tax evasion.', 'turning, then, to the particular statutory provision before us, appellee cannot successfully contend that the language and structure of sec.', '202(n), or the nature of the deprivation, requires us to recognize a punitive design.', 'cf.', 'wong wing v. united states, supra (imprisonment, at hard labor up to one year, of person found to be unlawfully in the country).', 'here the sanction is the mere denial of a noncontractual governmental benefit.', 'no affirmative disability or restraint is imposed, and certainly nothing approaching the infamous punishment of imprisonment, as in wong wing, on which great reliance is mistakenly placed.', 'moreover, for reasons already given (ante, pp.', '611-612), it cannot be said, as was said of the statute in cummings v. missouri, supra, at 319; see dent v. west virginia, 129 u.s. 114, 126, that the disqualification of certain deportees from receipt of social security benefits while they are not lawfully in this country bears no rational connection to the purposes of the legislation of which it is a part, and must without more therefore be taken as evidencing a congressional desire to punish.', 'appellee argues, however, that the history and scope of sec.', '202(n) prove that no such postulated purpose can be thought to have motivated the legislature, and that they persuasively show that a punitive purpose in fact lay behind the statute.', 'we do not agree.', 'we observe initially that only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on such a ground.', 'judicial inquiries into congressional motives are at best a hazardous matter, and when that inquiry seeks to go behind objective manifestations it becomes a dubious affair indeed.', 'moreover, the presumption of constitutionality with which this enactment, like any other, comes to us forbids us lightly to choose that reading of the statutes setting which will invalidate it over that which will save it.', 'it is not on slight implication and vague conjecture that the legislature is to be pronounced to have transcended its powers, and its acts to be considered as void.', 'fletcher v. peck, 6 cranch 87, 128. of the social security

states because of illegal entry, conviction of a crime, or subversive activity ... .', 'id., at 25. it was evidently the thought that such was the scope of the statute resulting from its application to deportation under the 14 named paragraphs of sec.', '241(a) of the immigration and nationality act.', 'id., at 77.', '(fn10) the senate committee rejected the proposal for the stated reason that it

beneficiarys deportation - which it is claimed alone would justify this legislation as being pursuant to a policy relevant to regulation of the social security system - but that it sought to reach certain grounds for deportation, thus evidencing a punitive intent.', '(fn12) it is impossible to find in the meagre history the unmistakable evidence of punitive intent which, under principles already discussed, is required before a congressional enactment of this kind may be struck down.', 'even were that history to be taken as evidencing congress concern with the grounds, rather than the fact, of deportation, we do not think that this, standing alone, would suffice to establish a punitive purpose.', 'this would still be a far cry from the situations involved in such cases as cummings, wong wing, and garland (see ante, p. 617), and from that in lovett, supra, where the legislation was on its face aimed at particular individuals.', 'the legislative record, however, falls short of any persuasive showing that congress was in fact concerned alone with the grounds of deportation.', 'to be sure congress did not apply the termination provision to all deportees.', 'however, it is evident that neither did it rest the operation of the statute on the occurrence of the underlying act.', 'the fact of deportation itself remained an essential condition for loss of benefits, and even if a beneficiary were saved from deportation only through discretionary suspension by the attorney general under sec.', '244 of the immigration and nationality act (66 stat.', '214, 8 u.s.c.', 'sec.', '1254), sec.', '202(n) would not reach him.', 'moreover, the grounds for deportation referred to in the committee report embrace the great majority of those deported, as is evident from an examination of the four omitted grounds, summarized in the margin.', '(fn13) inferences drawn from the omission of those grounds cannot establish, to the degree of certainty required, that congressional concern was wholly with the acts leading to deportation, and not with the fact of deportation.', '(fn14) to hold otherwise would be to rest on the slight implication and vague conjecture against which chief justice marshall warned.', 'fletcher v. peck, supra, at 128. the same answer must be made to arguments drawn from the failure of congress to apply sec.', '202(n) to beneficiaries voluntarily residing abroad.', 'but cf.', 'sec.', '202(t), ante, note 5. congress may have failed to consider such persons; or it may have thought their number too slight, or the permanence of their voluntary residence abroad too uncertain, to warrant application of the statute to them, with its attendant administrative problems of supervision and enforcement.', 'again, we cannot with confidence reject all those

appellee, ephram nestor, of his statutory right to old-age benefits in violation of the united states constitution.', 'nestor came to this country from bulgaria in 1913 and lived here continuously for 43 years, until july 1956. he was then deported from this country for having been a communist from 1933 to 1939. at that time membership in the communist party as such was not illegal and was not even a statutory ground for deportation.', 'from december 1936 to january 1955 nestor and his employers made regular payments to the government under the federal insurance contributions act, 26 u.s.c.', 'secs.', '3101-3125. these funds went to a special federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund under 49 stat.', '622, 53 stat.', '1362, as amended, 42 u.s.c.', 'sec.', '401, in return for which nestor, like millions of others, expected to receive payments when he reached the statutory age.', 'in 1954, 15 years after nestor had last been a communist, and 18 years after he began to make payments into the old-age security fund, congress passed a law providing, among other things, that any person who had been deported from this country because of past communist membership under 66 stat.', '205, 8 u.s.c.', 'sec.', '1251(a)(6)(c) should be wholly cut off from any benefits of the fund to which he had contributed under the law.', '68 stat.', '1083, 42 u.s.c.', 'sec.', '402(n).', 'after the government deported nestor in 1956 it notified his wife, who had remained in this country, that he was cut off and no further payments would be made to him.', 'this action, it seems to me, takes nestors insurance without just compensation and in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.', 'moreover, it imposes an ex post facto law and bill of attainder by stamping him, without a court trial, as unworthy to receive that for which he has paid and which the government promised to pay him.', 'the fact that the court is sustaining this action indicates the extent to which people are willing to go these days to overlook violations of the constitution perpetrated against anyone who has ever even innocently belonged to the communist party.', 'i. in lynch v. united states, 292 u.s. 571, this court unanimously held that congress was without power to repudiate and abrogate in whole or in part its promises to pay amounts claimed by soldiers under the war risk insurance act of 1917, secs.', '400-405, 40 stat.', '409. this court held that such a repudiation was inconsistent with the provision of the fifth amendment that no person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.', 'the court today puts the lynch case aside on the ground that it is hardly profitable to engage in conceptualizations regarding earned rights and gratuities.', 'from this sound premise the court goes on to say that while the right to social security benefits is in one sense earned, yet the governments insurance scheme now before us rests not on the idea of the contributors to the fund earning something, but simply provides that they may justly call upon the government in their later years, for protection from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journeys end is near.', 'these are nice words but they cannot conceal the fact that they simply tell the contributors to this insurance fund that despite their own and their employers payments the government, in paying the beneficiaries out of the fund, is merely giving them something for nothing and can stop doing so when it pleases.', 'this, in my judgment, reveals a complete misunderstanding of the purpose congress and the country had in passing that law.', 'it was then generally agreed, as it is today, that it is not desirable that aged people think of the government as giving them something for nothing.', 'an excellent statement of this view, quoted by mr. justice douglas in another connection, was made by senator george, the chairman of the finance committee when the social security act was passed, and one very familiar with the philosophy that brought it about: it comports better than any substitute we have discovered with the american concept that free men want to earn their security and not ask for doles - that what is due as a matter of earned right is far better than a gratuity ... social security is not a handout; it is not charity; it is not relief.', 'it is an earned right based upon the contributions and earnings of the individual.', 'as an earned right, the individual is eligible to receive his benefit in dignity and self-respect.', '102 cong.', 'rec.', '15110. the people covered by this act are now able to rely with complete assurance on the fact that they will be compelled to contribute regularly to this fund whenever each contribution falls due.', 'i believe they are entitled to rely with the same assurance on getting the benefits they have paid for and have been promised, when their disability or age makes their insurance payable under the terms of the law.', 'the court did not permit the government to break its plighted faith with the soldiers in the lynch case; it said the constitution forbade such governmental conduct.', 'i would say precisely the same thing here.', 'the court consoles those whose insurance is taken away today, and others who may suffer the same fate in the future, by saying that a decision requiring the social security system to keep faith would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to ever changing conditions which it demands.', 'people who pay premiums for insurance usually think they are paying for insurance, not for flexibility and boldness.', 'i cannot believe that any private insurance company in america would be permitted to repudiate its matured contracts with its policyholders who have regularly paid all their premiums in reliance upon the good faith of the company.', 'it is true, as the court says, that the original act contained a clause, still in force, that expressly reserves to congress the right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of the act.', 'sec.', '1104, 49 stat.', '648, 42 u.s.c.', 'sec.', '1304. congress, of course properly retained that power.', 'it could repeal the act so as to cease to operate its old-age insurance activities for the future.', 'this means that it could stop covering new people, and even stop increasing its obligations to its old contributors.', 'but that is quite different from disappointing the just expectations of the contributors to the fund which the government has compelled them and their employers to pay its treasury.', 'there is nothing conceptualistic about saying, as this court did in lynch, that such a taking as this the constitution forbids.', 'ii.', 'in part ii of its opinion, the court throws out a line of hope by its suggestion that if congress in the future cuts off some other group from the benefits they have bought from the government, this court might possibly hold that the future hypothetical act violates the due process clause.', 'in doing so it reads due process as affording only minimal protection, and under this reading it will protect all future groups from destruction of their rights only if congress manifests a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification.', 'the due process clause so defined provides little protection indeed compared with the specific safeguards of the constitution such as its prohibitions against taking private property for a public use without just compensation, passing ex post facto laws, and imposing bills of attainder.', 'i cannot agree, however, that the due process clause is properly interpreted when it is used to subordinate and dilute the specific safeguards of the bill of rights, and when due process itself becomes so wholly dependent upon this courts idea of what is arbitrary and rational.', 'see levine v. united states, 362 u.s. 610, 620 (dissenting opinion); adamson v. california, 332 u.s. 46, 89-92 (dissenting opinion); rochin v. california, 342 u.s. 165, 174 (concurring opinion).', 'one reason for my belief in this respect is that i agree with what is said in the courts quotation from helvering v. davis, 301 u.s. 619, 644: whether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of benefits set forth in title ii, it is not for us to say.', 'the answer to such inquiries must come from congress, not the courts.', 'our concern here, as often, is with power, not with wisdom.', 'and yet the courts assumption of its power to hold acts unconstitutional because the court thinks they are arbitrary and irrational can be neither more nor less than a judicial foray into the field of governmental policy.', 'by the use of this due process formula the court does not, as its proponents frequently proclaim, abstain from interfering with the congressional policy.', 'it actively enters that field with no standards except its own conclusion as to what is arbitrary and what is rational.', 'and this elastic formula gives the court a further power, that of holding legislative acts constitutional on the ground that they are neither arbitrary nor irrational, even though the acts violate specific bill of rights safeguards.', 'see my dissent in adamson v. california, supra.', 'whether this act had rational justification was, in my judgment, for congress; whether it violates the federal constitutional is for us to determine, unless we are by circumlocution to abdicate the power that this court has been held to have ever since marbury v. madison, 1 cranch 137. iii.', 'the court in part iii of its opinion holds that the 1954 act is not an ex post facto law or bill or attainder even though it creates a class of deportees who cannot collect their insurance benefits because they were once communists at a time when simply being a communist was not illegal.', 'the court also puts great emphasis on its belief that the act here is not punishment.', 'although not believing that the particular label punishment is of decisive importance, i think the act does impose punishment even in a classic sense.', 'the basic reason for nestors loss of his insurance payments is that he was once a communist.', 'this man, now 69 years old, has been driven out of the country where he has lived for 43 years to a land where he is practically a stranger, under an act authorizing his deportation many years after his communist membership.', 'cf.', 'galvan v. press, 347 u.s. 522, 532, 533 (dissenting opinions).', 'now a similar ex post facto law deprives him of his insurance, which, while petty and insignificant in amount to this great government, may well be this exiles daily bread, for the same reason and in accord with the general fashion of the day - that is, to punish in every way possible anyone who ever made the mistake of being a communist in this country or who is supposed ever to have been associated with anyone who made that mistake.', 'see, e.g., barenblatt v. united states, 360 u.s. 109, and uphaus v. wyman, 360 u.s. 72. in united states v. lovett, 328 u.s. 303, 315-316, we said:  ... legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the constitution.', 'faithful observance of our holdings in that case, in ex parte garland, 4 wall.', '333, and in cummings v. missouri, 4 wall.', '277, would, in my judgment, require us to hold that the 1954 act is a bill of attainder.', 'it is a congressional enactment aimed at an easily ascertainable group; it is certainly punishment in any normal sense of the word to take away from any person the benefits of an insurance system into which he and his employer have paid their moneys for almost two decades; and it does all this without a trial according to due process of law.', 'it is true that the lovett, cummings and garland court opinions were not unanimous, but they nonetheless represent positive precedents on highly important questions of individual liberty which should not be explained away with cobwebbery refinements.', 'if the court is going to overrule these cases in whole or in part, and adopt the views of previous dissenters, i believe it should be done clearly and forthrightly.', 'a basic constitutional infirmity of this act, in my judgment, is that it is a part of a pattern of laws all of which violate the first amendment out of fear that this country is in grave danger if it lets a handful of communist fanatics or some other extremist group make their arguments and discuss their ideas.', 'this fear, i think, is baseless.', 'it reflects a lack of faith in the sturdy patriotism of our people and does not give to the world a true picture of our abiding strength.', 'it is an unworthy fear in a country that has a bill of rights containing provisons for fair trials, freedom of speech, press and religion, and other specific safeguards designed to keep men free.', 'i repeat once more that i think this nations greatest security lies, not in trusting to a momentary majority of this courts view at any particular time of what is patently arbitrary, but in wholehearted devotion to and observance of our constitutional freedoms.', 'see wieman v. updegraff, 344 u.s. 183, 192 (concurring opinion).', 'i would affirm the judgment of the district court which held that nestor is constitutionally entitled to collect his insurance.', 'mr. justice douglas, dissenting.', 'appellee came to this country from bulgaria in 1913 and was employed, so as to be covered by the social security act, from december 1936 to january 1955 - a period of 19 years.', 'he became eligible for retirement and for social security benefits in november 1955 and was awarded $55.60 per month.', 'in july 1956 he was deported for having been a member of the communist party from 1933 to 1939. pursuant to a law, enacted september 1, 1954, he was thereupon denied payment of further social security benefits.', 'this 1954 law seems to me to be a classic example of a bill of attainder, which art.', 'i, sec.', '9 of the constitution prohibits congress from enacting.', 'a bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.', 'cummings v. missouri, 4 wall.', '277, 323. in the old days punishment was meted out to a creditor or rival or enemy by sending him to the gallows.', 'but as recently stated by irving brant: (fn1)  ... by smiting a man day after day with slanderous words, by taking away his opportunity to earn a living, you can drain the blood from his veins without even scratching his skin.', 'todays bill of attainder is broader than the classic form, and not so tall and sharp.', 'there is mental in place of physical torture, and confiscation of tommorrows bread and butter instead of yesterdays land and gold.', 'what is perfectly clear is that hate, fear and prejudice play the same role today, in the destruction of human rights in america that they did in england when a frenzied mob of lords, judges, bishops and shoemakers turned the titus oates blacklist into a hangmans record.', 'hate, jealousy and spite continue to fill the legislative attainder lists just as they did in the irish parliament of ex-king james.', 'bills of attainder, when they imposed punishment less than death, were bills of pains and penalties and equally beyond the constitutional power of congress.', 'cummings v. missouri, supra, at 323. punishment in the sense of a bill of attainder includes the deprivation or suspension of political or civil rights.', 'cummings v. missouri, supra, at 322. in that case it was barring a priest from practicing his profession.', 'in ex parte garland, 4 wall.', '333, it was excluding a man from practicing law in the federal courts.', 'in united states v. lovett, 328 u.s. 303, it was cutting off employees compensation and barring them permanently from government service.', 'cutting off a persons livelihood by denying him accrued social benefits - part of his property interests - is no less a

presumption might be a basis for sustaining the statute if in fact there were two opposing inferences which could reasonably be drawn from the legislation, one that it imposes punishment and the other that it is purposed to further the administration of the social security program.', 'the court, however, does not limit the presumption to that use.', 'rather the presumption becomes a complete substitute for any supportable finding of a rational connection of sec.', '202(n) with the social security program.', 'for me it is not enough to state the test and hold that the presumption alone satisfies it.', 'i find it necessary to examine the act and its consequences to ascertain whether there is ground for the inference of a congressional concern with the administration of the social security program.', 'only after this inquiry would i consider the application of the presumption.', 'the court seems to acknowledge that the statute bears harshly upon the individual disqualified, but states that this is permissible when a statute is enacted as a regulation of the activity.', 'but surely the harshness of the consequences is itself a relevant consideration to the inquiry into the congressional purpose.', '(fn3) cf.', 'trop v. dulles, 356 u.s. 86, 110 (concurring opinion).', 'it seems to me that the statute itself shows that the sole legislative concern was with the person or

agree that congress concern would have been with the activity or status and not with the person or class of persons disqualified.', 'the scales would then be tipped toward the conclusion that congress desired to limit benefit payments to beneficiaries residing in the united states so that the american economy would be aided by expenditure of benefits here.', 'indeed a proposal along those lines was submitted to congress in 1954, at the same time sec.', '202(n) was proposed, (fn4) and it was rejected.', '(fn5) perhaps, the courts conclusion that regulation of the activity or status was the

of unlawful entry, conviction of a crime, or subversive activity.', 'the acts as narcotic addiction or prostitution.', 'the common element of the 14 grounds is that the alien has been guilty of some blameworthy conduct.', 'in other words congress worked its will only on aliens deported for conduct displeasing to the lawmakers.', 'this is plainly demonstrated by the remaining four grounds of deportation, those which do not result in the cancellation of benefits.', '(fn7) two of those four grounds cover persons who become public charges within five years after entry for reasons which predated the entry.', 'a third ground covers the alien who fails to maintain his nonimmigrant status.', 'the fourth ground reaches the alien who, prior to or within five years after entry, aids other aliens to enter the country illegally.', 'those who are deported for becoming public charges clearly have not, by modern standards, engaged in conduct worthy of censure.', 'the governments suggestion that the reason for their exclusion from sec.', '202(n) was an unarticulated feeling of congress that it would be unfair to the other country to deport such destitute persons without letting them retain their modicum of social security benefits appears at best fanciful, especially since, by hypothesis, they are deportable because the conditions which led to their becoming public charges existed prior to entry.', 'the exclusion from the operation of sec.', '202(n) of aliens deported for failure to maintain nonimmigrant status rationally can be explained, in the context of the whole statute, only as evidencing that congress considered that conduct less blameworthy.', 'certainly the governments suggestion that congress may have thought it unlikely that such persons would work sufficient time in covered employment to become eligible for social security benefits cannot be the reason for this exclusion.', 'for frequently the very act which eventually results in the deportation of persons on that ground is the securing of private employment.', 'finally, it is impossible to reconcile the continuation of benefits to aliens who are deported for aiding other aliens to enter the country illegally, except upon the ground that congress felt that their conduct was less reprehensible.', 'again the governments suggestion that the reason might be congress belief that these aliens would not have worked in covered employment must be rejected.', 'five years after entry would be ample time within which to secure employment and qualify.', 'moreover the same five-year limitation applies to several of the 14 grounds of deportation for which aliens are cut off from benefits and the governments argument would apply equally to them if that in fact was the congressional reason.', 'this appraisal of the distinctions drawn by congress between various kinds of conduct impels the conclusion, beyond peradventure that the distinctions can be understood only if the purpose of congress was to strike at the person or class of persons disqualified.', 'the court inveighs against invalidating a statute on implicaton and vague conjecture.', 'rather i think the court has strained to sustain the statute on implication and vague conjecture, in holding that the congressional concern was the activity or status from which the individual is barred.', 'todays decision sanctions the use of the spending power not to further the legitimate objectives of the social security program but to inflict hurt upon those who by their conduct have incurred the displeasure of congress.', 'the framers ordained that even the worst of men should not be punished for their past acts or for any conduct without adherence to the procedural safeguards written into the

politifact15280,"['a leaked hillary clinton email confirms that the obama administration, with hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in syria to benefit israel.the new wikileaks release shows the then secretary of state ordering a war in syria in order to overthrow the government and oust president assad, claiming it was the “best way to help israel”.newobserveronline.com reports:the document was one of many unclassified by the us department of state under case number f-2014-20439, doc no.', 'c05794498, following the uproar over clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.although the wikileaks transcript dates the email as december 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to may 2012 talks between iran and the west over its nuclear program in istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on december 31, 2012.the email makes it clear that it has been us policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in israel’s interests.“the best way to help israel deal with iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of syria overthrow the regime of bashar assad,” clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.even though all us intelligence reports had long dismissed iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the international atomic energy agency), clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying syria in the name of israel.she specifically links iran’s mythical atom bomb program to syria because, she says, iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the middle east.if iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, clinton asserts, this would allow syria (and other “adversaries of israel” such as saudi arabia and egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten israel’s interests.therefore, clinton, says, syria has to be destroyed.iran’s nuclear program and syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are.', 'what israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.an iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like saudi arabia and egypt, to go nuclear as well.', 'the result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on syria and lebanon, as it can today.if iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in syria and hezbollah to strike israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to israel responding against iran itself.it is, clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between iran and the regime of bashar assad in syria” that makes it possible for iran to undermine israel’s security.this would not come about through a “direct attack,” clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between iran and israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”the end of the assad regime would end this dangerous alliance.', 'israel’s leadership understands well why defeating assad is now in its interests.bringing down assad would not only be a massive boon to israel’s security, it would also ease israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.then, israel and the united states might be able to develop a common view of when the iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening bashar assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:in short, the white house can ease the tension that has developed with israel over iran by doing the right thing in syria.with his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the syrian dictator bashar assad’s mind.the email proves—as if any more proof was needed—that the us government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the middle east, and all in order to “protect” israel.it is also a sobering thought to consider that the “refugee” crisis which currently threatens to destroy europe, was directly sparked off by this us government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in syria.in addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the syrian conflict, which has spread to iraq—all thanks to clinton and the obama administration backing the “rebels” and stoking the fires of war in syria.the real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like clinton—whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people—could become the next president of america is the most deeply shocking thought of all.clinton’s public assertion that, if elected president, she would “take the relationship with israel to the next level,” would definitively mark her, and israel, as the enemy of not just some arab states in the middle east, but of all peace-loving people on earth.']","['assad isnt good before isis assad was still killing his own people', 'evil woman thats what she and trump wants', 'israel ambassador pushes war to elite us powerbrokers mintpressnews',

statement issued by the rich family tuesday which also includes that the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.now, questions have been raised on why d.c. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.wheeler, a former d.c. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into rich’s murder.', 'he said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.the police department nor the fbi have been forthcoming,” said wheeler.', '“they havent been cooperating at all.', 'i believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which i believe is either at the police department or either at the fbi.', 'i have been told both.”when we asked wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links rich to wikileaks, he said, “absolutely.', 'yeah.', 'thats confirmed.wheeler also told us, i have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘rod, we were told to stand down on this case and i can’t share any information with you.’ now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department.', 'again, i don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but i do believe there is a correlation between the mayors office and the dnc and that is the information that will come out [tuesday].wheeler told fox 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.fox 5s melanie alnwick spoke with d.c. police on tuesday and was told that wheeler’s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the rich case was false.the family sent alnwick a statement on tuesday with the following statement:as weve seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press.', 'even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and weve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so.', 'we are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seths murderers.', 'the services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.previous

americans become basically, you know, homeless and losing the american dream.i want to have an interest rate freeze for five years, because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, the problem will just get compounded.', 'and we need more transparency in the market.then, i think we need to give people about $650, if they qualify -- which will be millions of people -- to help pay their energy bills this winter.', 'you know, there are so many people on fixed incomes and working people who are not going to be able to afford the spike in energy costs.we need to make sure that we start jumpstarting the jobs in this country again.', 'thats why i want to put money into clean energy jobs, green-collar jobs, and also make sure we have a fund that will help communities deal with the consequences of the home foreclosure crisis and make sure the unemployment system is up to the task.and then we will have money for rebates, but lets make them the right rebates.', 'everything we know about president bushs plans would leave 50 million to 70 million americans out, because a lot of our seniors on fixed incomes dont pay income taxes.', 'but that doesnt mean theyre immune from the energy costs and the health care costs and everything else thats going up around them.and we have a huge number of working people who thankfully dont pay income tax.', 'they pay payroll tax.', 'they pay a lot of other taxes.', 'president bushs plan would do nothing to help them.but thankfully weve got leaders of the congressional black caucus here who are going to make sure that we get the right kind of stimulus.', 'and thats what the democrats are going to support.its imperative we do it.', 'its a part of economic justice, which on dr. kings holiday is part of his unfinished legacy.wolf blitzer, cnn: all right.senator obama?(applause)sen.', 'barack obama: well, we do meet on the king holiday.', 'and i think its important to remember that, in the march on washington, where dr. king always talks about -- or its always repeated, the dream speech that is so famous -- that march was for jobs, as well as justice.and, unfortunately, we have not made the kind of progress that we need in having a balanced economy, and george bush has made it worse.george bush has consistently skewed our tax code to the wealthy.', 'he has squandered billions of dollars in a war that i believe should never have been authorized and should have never been waged.', '(applause)we have not made the investments that are needed in our school system.', 'you travel around south carolina along the corridor of shame, and youve got children who are going to schools that were built in the 1800s.', 'and they are not able to compete in an international economy.so it is absolutely critical right now to give a stimulus to the economy.', 'and senator clinton mentioned tax rebates.', 'that wasnt the original focus of her plan.', 'i think recently she has caught up with what i had originally said, which is weve got to get taxes into the -- tax cuts into the pockets of hard-working americans right away.and it is important for us to make sure that they are not just going to the wealthy.', 'they should be going to folks who are making $75,000 a year or less, and they should be going to folks who only pay payroll tax, but typically are not paying income tax.if we do that, then not only can we stimulate the economy, those are the folks who are most likely to spend money right away.blitzer: do you agree with her, $650 is a good number for a tax rebate?obama: well, i think that we are going to have to get some immediate money.', 'what i do is i say, for a typical family, $500 for a tax rebate per family.but also, for senior citizens, get a supplement to their social security check, because they get that every month.', 'we know exactly how to do it.', 'and that would provide seniors all across the country right away some money to help pay for their heating bills and other expenses that theyve got right now.blitzer: correct me if im wrong, senator edwards.', 'your plan does not call for a tax rebate, does it?former sen. john edwards: no, thats exactly right.', 'can i start by saying how proud i am to be here tonight, a debate sponsored by the congressional black caucus on dr. kings holiday?and particularly on this night, when were honoring the legacy of dr. king, central to his work was the idea of fighting for real equality between the races, fighting to end poverty in america, his famous poor peoples campaign, which he was engaged in at the time of his death, fighting for garbage workers, actually, in memphis.and the chasm between the rich and the poor in america is wide.', 'it is getting worse.', 'the rich are get richer.', 'and weve added five million people to the poverty rolls in just over the course of the last seven years, which is...blitzer: but what about the stimulus package?edwards: heres what we should do.', 'thats why im getting to this.', 'what bush does is he leaves 50 million -- as hillary pointed out -- 50 million americans.', 'theyre low-income americans and moderate-income americans.', 'they are completely left out of the stimulus package.if were actually going to deal with the legacy of dr. king, if were going to deal with this issue of poverty -- and i have a comprehensive plan to do that, it is the cause of my life, to end poverty in this country -- we also have to include all americans in this stimulus plan.now, one difference between what i have proposed and what my two colleagues have proposed is i have done something that not only stimulates the economy, but creates long-term benefits, investment in green infrastructure, which creates jobs.instead of just getting money out in the short term, this will actually create jobs over the long term, create green infrastructure.yes, we need to do something about the mortgage crisis.', 'i want to mention one last thing.there is one other issue that was mentioned in passing by the two of them, which is the issue of jobs.', 'and there is a difference between myself and my colleagues on this issue of jobs, because they both supported the peru trade deal.my view is the peru trade deal was similar to nafta.', 'and this is crucial to the state of south carolina...blitzer: but...edwards: ... no, no -- and crucial to the state of the south carolina and jobs in south carolina.', 'south carolina has been devastated by nafta and trade deals like nafta.blitzer: i just want to be precise.', 'what youre proposing are really long-term objectives.', 'in terms of a short-term stimulus package, you disagree with them on an immediate tax rebate.edwards: no, no.', 'what im saying is if we do what we should do to green the economy, if we change our unemployment insurance laws, modernize them to make them available to more people, to more americans, if we in fact give help to the states, which gets money straight into the economy and we deal with the mortgage crisis in a serious way with a home rescue fund to provide transitional financing for those people who are about to lose their homes, all those things will stimulate the economy.blitzer: ill let both of you respond, but let me let senator obama respond first.', '(applause)obama: let me just respond to a couple of things.', 'i think the idea of bringing jobs is important, which is why thats central to my energy plan.', 'but, wolf, youre exactly right, that is a long-term agenda.', 'that is not going to deal with the immediate crisis we have right now.youve got the european markets dropped 5 percent.', 'the expectation is that the dow jones tomorrow may do the same.', 'we could be sliding into an extraordinary recession unless we stimulate the economy immediately.', 'thats point number one.point number two, on trade, john is exactly right that you travel around south carolina and you see the textile mills that johns father worked in closed, all over the region.', 'and it is absolutely true that nafta was a mistake.i know that hillary on occasion has said -- just last year said this was a boon to the economy.', 'i think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the u.s. were getting a square deal.but the only thing i want to differ on john is this whole notion of peru.', 'the peru trade deal had labor and environmental agreements in it.', 'peru is an economy the size of new hampshire.', 'over 90 percent of the goods coming from peru already come in under various free trade agreements.and, john, you voted for permanent trade relations with china, which i think anybody who looks at how we structure trade in this country would tell you has been the biggest beneficiary and the biggest problem that we have with respect to trade, particularly because theyre still manipulating the currency.blitzer: ill let you respond, but, senator clinton, i want to get back to the issue of an immediate stimulus for the economy.clinton: thats what i want to get back to.blitzer: because who knows what the markets are going to be like tomorrow and there are a lot of people out there who are suffering already.', 'but go ahead and respond.clinton: well, i want to just clarify a couple of points.', 'my original plan was $70 billion in spending with a $40 billion contingency that was part of the original plan, in order to have that money available for tax rebates.i hope that we could do it through spending, and heres why: i dont want to necessarily open up the tax code while weve got republicans in the senate who are going to try to come back and open up making bushs tax cuts permanent.', '(applause)i understand that thats a real risk.', 'so i was hoping to be able to do it through spending, but the crisis has gotten too deep, and what happened in the markets globally today is a huge wakeup call.the president should convene the working group on financial markets.', 'he should ask the secretary of treasury to do this immediately.', 'i know that theres been talking going on, but the presidents proposed stimulus package is not adequate.', 'it is too little too late and it doesnt give enough money to the people who are hardest hit by the increased costs in energy and everything else.', '(applause)as a further point, i do believe that the green-collar job piece of this is important.', 'thats why i have $5 billion to do it.', 'there are programs already.', 'oakland, california, mayor dellums is working to have a green-collar job program.', 'we could put hundreds and hundreds of young people to work right now, putting solar panels in, insulating homes.that would give them jobs and it would move us more quickly to a green economy.', 'and i think that if you look at this from a jobs and justice, a stimulation and long-term planning effort, we need to lay down the markers now.', 'and thats why the congress, under the leadership of a lot of the people who are chairs of committees and subcommittees who are here today are going to play a major role in this.', 'and weve got to hold the line against president bush with his ill-advised approach to stimulating the economy.blitzer: all right.', 'were staying on topic.', 'were staying on this subject, but i want to ask suzanne malveaux to ask a question and then all of you will be able to weigh...edwards: you have to give me a chance to respond to senator obama.blitzer: all right, go ahead, respond quickly and then suzanne.edwards: thank you.well, first of all, what i have proposed for green-collar jobs will create jobs within 30 or so days, so we will have an immediate impact on the economy and stimulate the economy.', 'second, no one has to explain to me what these trade deals have done to south carolina, to north carolina.', 'my father, whos sitting right out there in the audience, worked in the mills for 36 years and we have seen what these trade deals have done to people who have worked hard all their lives.edwards: and the problem with peru, barack, is you are leaving the enforcement of environmental and labor regulations in the hands of george bush.i wouldnt trust george bush to enforce anything, certainly no trade obligations.', '(applause)blitzer: all right.', 'ten seconds, go ahead.', '(applause)obama: well, the only point i would make is that in a years time, itll be me whos enforcing them.', '(applause)and so were going to make sure that the right thing is being done.', 'and, john, you tell an extraordinarily powerful story.', 'i mean, you understand whats happened with respect to trade here and i think it is powerful when you talk about it.but keep in mind, i first moved to chicago to be a community organizer with churches who were trying to deal with the devastation of steel plants that had closed in that region.', 'and so i spent 3.5 years working alongside folks who had lost their jobs.and i know what its like for families to have put their life and their heart and soul into a company, building profits for shareholders, and then suddenly they had the rug pulled out from under them.', 'not only have they lost their job, theyve lost their health care, theyve lost their pension benefits.and it is absolutely critical for us to understand that nafta was an enormous problem.', 'the permanent trade relations with china, without some of the enforcement mechanisms that were in there, that you voted for, was also a significant problem.and weve got to all move forward as democrats to make sure that weve got trade deals that work for working people and not just for corporate profits.blitzer: all right.', 'suzanne malveaux, go ahead.', '(applause)suzanne malveaux, cnn: id like to follow-up with senator obama.', 'it was just a few days ago that senator clinton asserted that she was the strongest candidate when it comes to fiscal responsibility.she says that the new programs that she proposes she essentially can pay for.', 'she says that you have failed in that regard in the tune of some $50 billion worth of new programs that you cannot account for.how do you respond to that charge?obama: what she said wasnt true.', 'we account for every single dollar that we propose.now, this, i think, is one of the things thats happened during the course of this campaign, that theres a set of assertions made by senator clinton, as well as her husband, that are not factually accurate.and i think that part of what the people are looking for right now is somebody whos going to solve problems and not resort to the same typical politics that weve seen in washington.', '(applause)that is something that i hear all across the country.', 'so when senator clinton says -- or president clinton says that i wasnt opposed to the war from the start or says its a fairytale that i opposed the war, that is simply not true.when senator clinton or president clinton asserts that i said that the republicans had had better economic policies since 1980, that is not the case.now, the viewers arent concerned with this kind of back-and- forth.', 'what theyre concerned about is whos actually going to help the get health care, how are they going to get their kids...(applause)... going to college, and thats the kind of campaign ive tried to run.', 'i think thats the kind of campaign we should all try to run.', '(applause)clinton: well, i couldnt agree more.', 'but i do think that your record and what you say does matter.', 'and when it comes to...(applause)... a lot of the issues that are important in this race, it is sometimes difficult to understand what senator obama has said, because as soon as he is confronted on it, he says thats not what he meant.the facts are that he has said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the republicans over the last 10 to 15 years, and we can give you the exact quote.now, i personally think they had ideas, but they were bad ideas.', 'they were bad ideas for america.', '(applause)they were ideas like privatizing social security, like moving back from a balanced budget and a surplus to deficit and debt.and with respect to putting forth how one would pay for all of the programs that were proposing in this campaign, i will be more than happy, barack, to get the information, because we have searched for it.you have a lot of money that you want to put into foreign aid, a very worthy program.', 'there is no evidence from your web site, from your speeches, as to how you would pay for it.now, why is this important?', 'its important because i think elections are about the future.', 'but how do you determine what will happen in the future?', 'well, you have to look to the record, you have to look to what we say in campaigns, and what we have done during our careers.and i want to be just very explicit about this.', 'we are not, neither my campaign nor anyone associated with it, are in any way saying you did not oppose the war in iraq.clinton: you did.', 'you gave a great speech in 2002 opposing the war in iraq.', 'that was not what the point of our criticism was.it was after having given that speech, by the next year the speech was off your web site.', 'by the next year, you were telling reporters that you agreed with president bush in his conduct of the war.', 'and by the next year, when you were in the senate, you were voting to fund the war time after time after time.blitzer: all right.clinton: so it was more about the distinction between words and action.', 'and i think that is a fair assessment for voters to make.', '(applause)blitzer: ok. thank you, senator.', 'senator, were a little off topic.', 'i have to let senator obama respond, then senator edwards, whos going to come...obama: were off topic, but...blitzer: but go ahead and respond, and then i want to get back to this issue that were talking about, fiscal responsibility.', 'but go ahead.obama: lets talk about it.hillary, i will be happy to provide you with the information about all -- all the spending that we do.', 'now, lets talk about ronald reagan.', 'what you just repeated here today is...clinton: barack...obama: wait.', 'no.', 'hillary, you just spoke.clinton: i did not say anything about ronald reagan.obama: you just spoke for two minutes.clinton: you said two things.obama: you just...clinton: you talked about admiring ronald reagan and you talked about the ideas...obama: hillary, im sorry.', 'you just...blitzer: senator...clinton: i didnt talk about reagan.obama: hillary, we just had the tape.', 'you just said that i complimented the republican ideas.', 'that is not true.what i said -- and i will provide you with a quote -- what i said was is that ronald reagan was a transformative political figure because he was able to get democrats to vote against their economic interests to form a majority to push through their agenda, an agenda that i objected to.', 'because while i was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at wal-mart.', '(applause)obama: i was fighting these fights.', 'i was fighting these fights.', 'so -- but i want to be clear.so i want to be clear.', 'what i said had nothing to do with their policies.', 'i spent a lifetime fighting a lifetime against ronald reagans policies.', 'but what i did say is that we have to be thinking in the same transformative way about our democratic agenda.weve got to appeal to independents and republicans in order to build a working majority to move an agenda forward.', 'that is what i said.', '(applause)obama: now, you can dispute that, but let me finish.hillary, you went on for two minutes.', 'let me finish.the irony of this is that you provided much more fulsome praise of ronald reagan in a book by tom brokaw thats being published right now, as did -- as did bill clinton in the past.', 'so these are the kinds of political games that we are accustomed to.clinton: now, wait a minute.wolf, wait a minute.', 'wait a minute.', 'just a minute.blitzer: senator edwards, let them wrap up.', 'then im going to come to you.yes?clinton: i just want -- i just to clarify -- i want to clarify the record.', 'wait a minute.edwards: theres a third person in this debate.blitzer: wait a minute, senator edwards.', 'hold on.there has been a specific charge leveled against hillary clinton, so she can respond.', 'then ill bring in senator edwards.clinton: i just want to be sure...obama: go ahead and address what you said about...blitzer: we have got a long time to.', 'youll have a good opportunity.clinton: were just getting warmed up.', '(applause)clinton: now, i just -- i just want to be clear about this.', 'in an editorial board with the reno newspaper, you said two different things, because i have read the transcript.', 'you talked about ronald reagan being a transformative political leader.', 'i did not mention his name.obama: your husband did.clinton: well, im here.', 'hes not.', 'and...obama: ok. well, i cant tell who im running against sometimes.', '(applause)clinton: well, you know, i think we both have very passionate and committed spouses who stand up for us.', 'and im proud of that.but you also talked about the republicans having ideas over the last 10 to 15 years.obama: i didnt say they were good ones.clinton: well, you can read the context of it.obama: well, i didnt say they were good ones.clinton: well, it certainly...obama: all right, wolf.clinton: it certainly came across in the way that it was presented, as though the republicans had been standing up against the conventional wisdom with their ideas.', 'im just reacting to the fact, yes, they did have ideas, and they were bad ideas.obama: i agree.clinton: bad for america, and i was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, resco, in his slum landlord business in inner city chicago.', '(applause)obama: no, no, no.blitzer: hold on one second.', 'hold on.senator edwards -- senator edwards has been remarkably patient during this exchange.', 'and i want him -- i dont know if you want to get involved in this, senator edwards.edwards: what i want to say first is, are there three people in this debate, not two?', '(applause)edwards: and i also want to know -- i also want to know on behalf of voters here in south carolina, this kind of squabbling, how many children is this going to get health care?', 'how many people are going to get an education from this?', 'how many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this?edwards: we have got to understand -- you know, and i respect both of my fellow candidates -- but we have got to understand this is not about us personally.', 'it is about...(applause)... what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in.now, fiscal responsibility, which i think was the question.', 'it was a little hard to tell there at the end of that.', 'but i think the question was about fiscal responsibility.i have proposed, i think, the most aggressive, most progressive agenda of the three of us up here.', 'and i was the first to come out with a universal health care plan, first to come out with a global warming plan, first -- and, to the best of my knowledge, only at this point -- to come out with a comprehensive, detailed plan to end poverty in america, since we are on dr. kings day.this is the cause of my life.', 'everything i have proposed, i have come up with a way to pay for it.', 'and ive been very explicit about how it should be paid for, not abstract, not rhetoric, very, very explicit.but i do have to say, in response to something senator clinton said just a minute ago, both senator obama and i have said social security needs a solution.', 'and we have said we wont privatize, we wont cut benefits, we wont raise the retirement age.', 'same thing that hillary has said.but she has proposed nothing about how were going to create revenue to keep social security alive and talked about fiscal responsibility.', 'heres the problem: if you dont have -- this is not complicated.', 'the american people understand it.', 'if youve got more money going out than is coming in, youre going to eventually run out of money.and youve got to have a way to pay for it, which is why -- now, let me finish this.', 'lord knows you let them go on forever.', '(applause)what im saying is we have to be consistent in what were saying.', 'i have said i think hillary doesnt want to talk about raising taxes.', 'lets just be honest about that.barack and i have both said that youve got to do something about the cap on social security taxes, which is now capped at $97,000.', 'it means if somebody is making $80,000 a year, every dime of their income is taxed for social security.', 'but if you are making $50 million a year, only the first $97,000 is taxed.thats not right.', 'and people ought to be paying their social security taxes.', 'but the american people deserve to know what were going to do.we can disagree.', 'theres nothing wrong with that, so they can make an informed choice, but they at least deserve to know where they stand and what wed do.blitzer: were staying on the economy, but i want joe johns to ask another question so we can continue this dialogue.johns: all right.', 'well, senator edwards, lets dig a little deeper on the economic mess were in currently.in 2006, a study from the center for responsible lending found that african-americans are something like 30 percent more likely to be sold a subprime loan than white borrowers with similar credit histories and income.the south carolina naacp said last month that the american dream for too many americans, too many african-americans is a national nightmare.', 'the national naacp has even filed a class-action lawsuit against 12 nationwide lenders.so the bottom-line question really is: do you believe that lenders have specifically targeted african-americans?', 'is this subprime mess really also an issue of race?edwards: yes, is the answer.', 'i think they have targeted -- if they havent been racially motivated, i dont know.', 'theres no way for me to know whats inside their head.but what they have done is they have targeted the lowest income, most vulnerable families.', 'and anybody whos paying any attention to whats going on in america today understands, if you are african- american in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have.this is not an accident.', 'i mean, we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened, pretend that we didnt live through decades of slavery, followed by decades of segregation, followed by decades of discrimination, which is still going on today.', '(applause)that history and that legacy has consequences.', 'and the consequence has been that african-american families are more vulnerable.', 'theyre more vulnerable to payday lenders.', 'theyre more vulnerable to predatory lenders, which is why we desperately need a national law, which i have proposed, which would crack down on these predatory payday lenders.its not enough to do it state-by-state, because these predators just move from place to place to place.i was in a neighborhood in cleveland a few months ago, one-block radius, 38 houses under foreclosure, middle-class, african-american neighborhood.', 'these people work.', 'they put everything they had into their homes.', 'and they were about to lose them because these predators have come into the neighborhood and taken everything they have.so here are the solutions.', 'number one, we need a national predatory lending law.', 'number two, weve got to help low-income families save.edwards: they have nothing to fall back on.', 'many have no bank account.', 'they dont deal with financial institutions.', 'we need to teach financial literacy, we need to match what theyre able to save so that they actually have something that they can fall back on in case they get in a place where they need more money.', '(applause)blitzer: all right.', 'i want both senator clinton and senator obama to respond.but, briefly, senator clinton, your proposal calls for a five- year moratorium on interest rates, 90-day moratorium on foreclosure, five year keeping those interest rates the same.', 'alan greenspan suggested that we simply have to let this housing crisis exhaust itself.', 'trying to prevent the housing markets from going down merely prolongs the agony.does your plan, as he would seem to be suggesting, prolong the agony?clinton: no.', 'i think it helps to mitigate the agony.', 'i mean, what i hear as i go in and out of peoples homes and talk to so many who have already lost their homes, theyre in foreclosure, they see these interest rates that are about to go up and they know they cant pay them, is that we take action now.ive been calling for action since last march.', 'when i first started calling for it, a lot of the same economists who now say dont do anything about it said, well, it wont be that bad.', 'well be able to weather the crisis.well, the fact is, the mortgage crisis is not only destroying the dreams of americans for home ownership, it is having a ripple effect across the world.', 'so my moratorium for 90 days is a work-out.', 'its not a bailout.', 'i want people to be able to see whether they can stay in their homes paying a rate that is affordable for them.and the interest rate freeze is i think merited, because look at whats happening -- if youre a big bank that helped get us into this mess, you go borrow money from abu dhabi or somewhere.', 'if youre a homeowner who has been at the bottom of this incredible scheme that was established, youre left holding the bag and you dont have the house anymore.blitzer: thank you, senator.clinton: so i just disagree with those who say dont try to do anything to help the people who need the help right now.blitzer: senator obama.obama: i think that we need to help them.', 'i think it is important to make sure that were not helping out the speculators, but instead are helping out the homeowners who are actually living in their homes, who have the capacity to make the payments if theyre not seeing a huge increase in their mortgage payments.but understand this, this is not new.', 'we have a history in this country of preying on low-income peoples because they dont have access to banks.', 'the community reinvestment act is oftentimes not enforced as it should be.weve got to open up bank branches.', 'weve got to give people access to financing so that theyre not going to a payday loan operation.i two years ago introduced a provision that would eliminate predatory lending, something that i had already helped to get passed at the state level.', 'but it is important for us to understand that weve got to give ordinary working people access to financing.', 'and its important to understand that part of the reason that they are borrowing on their homes, theyre borrowing on credit cards, is that the banks and financial institutions have dominated policy in washington.and this is an area where ive got a policy disagreement with senator clinton.', 'when we talked a while back, just in the last debate, we talked about the bankruptcy bill, which had been pushed by the banks and the financial institutions, that said, basically, it will be harder for folks who have been lured into these teaser rates and then see their credit cards go up to 30 percent, that they would have a tougher time getting out of bankruptcy.in the last debate, senator clinton said she voted for it but hoped that it wouldnt pass.', 'now, i dont understand that approach to legislation.', 'i think it is important for us to stand up to these special interests consistently, all the time, and thats what ive done and thats what i will continue to...blitzer: im going to go to suzanne...clinton: wait, wolf, i have to answer this.blitzer: im going to go to suzanne malveaux in a second, but i just want to give you a chance, senator obama, if you want to respond.', 'senator clinton made a serious allegation that you worked for a slumlord.', 'and i wonder if you want to respond.obama: im happy to respond.', 'heres what happened: i was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project and i did about five hours worth of work on this joint project.', 'thats what shes referring to.now, its fine for her to throw that out, but the larger reason that i think this debate is important is because we do have to trust our leaders and what they say.', 'that is important, because if we cant, then were not going to be able to mobilize the american people behind bringing about changes in health care reform, bringing about changes in how were going to put people back to work, changing our trade laws.', 'and consistency matters.', 'truthfulness during campaigns makes a difference.', '(applause)and thats what ive tried to do and i will continue to try to do as president of the united states.clinton: now, let me start with the claim about the bankruptcy bill.', 'i said very clearly i regretted voting for it and i was happy that it didnt get into law.by 2005, there was another run at a bankruptcy reform, motivated by the credit card companies and the other big lenders.', 'i opposed that bill.', 'i said very forcefully i opposed that bill.there was a particular amendment that i think is very telling.', 'it was an amendment to prohibit credit card companies from charging more than 30 percent interest.senator obama voted for it.', 'i voted against it.', 'it was one of the biggest lobbyist victories on that very bad bill that the bankruptcy bill represented.and i think its important.', 'you know, if you look at the recent article about senator obamas work on health care reform in the illinois legislature, its a very interesting piece about how he basically did the bidding of the insurance companies during that effort.now, im just saying that if were going to...obama: thats...clinton: ... be hurling these charges against one another, im used to taking the incoming fire.', 'ive taken it for 16 years.', 'but when you get into this

30 percent what credit card companies could charge.senator obama did not.', 'thats a fact.', '(crosstalk)obama: absolutely.', 'it is a fact, because i thought 30 percent potentially was too high of a ceiling.', 'so we had had no hearings...(applause)... on that bill.', 'it had not gone through the banking committee.', 'i dont know about a lot of folks here, most folks here, if theyve got a credit card, are paying 29 percent.', 'so under this provision, that wouldve been fine.and we had not created the kind of serious...edwards: you voted against it because the limit was too high, is that what you just said?obama: that is exactly what i just said, john, because...edwards: so theres no limit at all.obama: ... there had been no discussions...(applause)hold on, john.', 'hold on.', 'listen to this.', 'there had been no discussion about how we were going to structure this and this was something that had not gone through the committee and we hadnt talked about.it didnt make sense for us to cap interest rates...clinton: so you voted with the credit card companies.obama: no.clinton: thats the bottom line.obama: hillary, i opposed that bill and you know i did.', '(applause)clinton: well...obama: and consistently did and unlike you and john who voted for it previously.but heres the point.', 'what we have to do is weve got to have consistency in how we vote.', 'you cant say one thing during the campaign trail and then apologize afterward and say it was a mistake, and that has repeatedly happened during the course of this campaign...(applause)... and i think that tells you the kind of president that folks are going to be.clinton: well, you know, senator obama, it is very difficult having a straight-up debate with you, because you never take responsibility for any vote, and that has been a pattern.you, in the -- now, wait a minute.', 'in the illinois state legislature...(audience booing)clinton: just a minute.', 'in the illinois state senate, senator obama voted 130 times present.', 'thats not yes, thats not no.', 'thats maybe.', 'and on issue after issue that really were hard to explain or understand, you know, voted present on keeping sex shops away from schools, voted present on limiting the rights of victims of sexual abuse, voted present time and time again.and anytime anyone raises that, theres always some kind of explanation like you just heard about the 30 percent.', 'its just very difficult to get a straight answer, and thats what we are probing for.obama: i feel bad for john...blitzer (?', '): i know.', '(applause)obama: ... because i know johns not getting a lot of time here.let me just respond to this.blitzer (?', '): you can...obama: i feel pretty bad, i do.', 'i feel pretty bad.', 'but lets just respond to the example that was just thrown out.the bill with respect to privacy for victims of sexual abuse is a bill i had actually sponsored, hillary.', 'i actually sponsored the bill.', 'it got through the senate.', '(applause)that was on the back of 12 other provisions that i was able to pass in the state legislature.', 'nobody has worked harder than me in the illinois state legislature to make sure that victims of sexual abuse were dealt with, partly because ive had family members who were victims of sexual abuse and ive got two daughters who i want to protect.what happened on that particular provision was that after i had sponsored it and helped to get it passed, it turned out that there was a legal provision in it that was problematic and needed to be fixed so that it wouldnt be struck down.but when you comb my 4,000 votes in illinois, choose one...(applause)... try to present it in the worst possible light, that does have to be answered.', 'that does have to be answered.obama: and as i said before, the reason this makes a difference -- and i understand that most viewers want to know, how am i going to get helped in terms of paying my health care?', 'how am i going to get help being able to go to college?all those things are important.', 'but whats also important that people are not just willing to say anything to get elected.', 'and...(applause)blitzer: senator...obama: ... thats what i have tried to do in this campaign, is try to maintain a certain credibility.i dont mind having policy debates with senator clinton or senator edwards.', 'but what i dont enjoy is spending the week or two weeks or the last month having to answer to these kinds of criticisms that are not factually accurate.', '(applause)obama: and the press has looked at them.', 'they are not accurate.', 'and you need to present them as accurate.blitzer: were going to be coming back.clinton: well, that law is still on the books.', 'it was never struck down.', 'that was there.blitzer: were going to be visiting all these subjects, but i just want senator edwards to weigh in.', 'suzanne has got an excellent question coming up.go ahead.', '(laughter)edwards: shes been wanting to ask it, too.can i just ask, though, before i do -- i mean, i hear the back and forth on this one particular vote, but it is -- i do think its important, and i mentioned this about senator clinton earlier, to be fair, about social security.', 'i do think its important whether you are willing to take hard positions.i mean, the members of the congressional black caucus who are sitting in front of me right know they have to go to the floor of the house every day and vote on hard issues.', 'and they have to vote up or down or not show up to vote -- one of those three choices.', 'what i didnt hear was an explanation for why over 100 times you voted present instead of yes or no when you had a choice to vote up or down.', '(applause)obama: ill be happy to answer it.', 'because in illinois -- in illinois, oftentimes you vote present in order to indicate that you had problems with a bill that otherwise you might be willing to vote for.', 'and oftentimes you would have a strategy that would help move the thing forward.keep in mind, john, i voted for 4,000 bills.', 'and if you want to know whether or not i worked on tough stuff, i passed the first racial...edwards: i dont question whether you worked on tough stuff.obama: no, no, no.', 'hold on a second.edwards: i dont question whether you worked on tough stuff.obama: no, no.', 'but you...edwards: the question is, why would you over 100 times vote present?', 'i mean, every one of us -- every one -- youve criticized hillary.', 'youve criticized me for our votes.obama: right.edwards: weve cast hundreds and hundreds of votes.', 'what youre criticizing her for, by the way, youve done to us, which is you pick this vote and that vote out of the hundreds that weve cast.', '(applause)obama: no.edwards: and what -- all im saying is, whats fair is fair.', 'you have every right to defend any vote.', 'you do.obama: right.edwards: and i respect your right to do that on any -- on any substantive issue.', 'it does not make sense to me -- and what if i had just not shown up...obama: john -- john, illinois...edwards: wait, wait, wait.', 'wait, let me finish.obama: hold on a second.edwards: what if i had just not shown up to vote on things that really mattered to this country?', 'it would have been safe for me politically.', 'it would have been the careful and cautious thing to do, but i have a responsibility to take a position...obama: john, you...edwards: ... even when it has political consequences for me.', '(applause) consequences.', 'this -- most of these were technical problems with a piece of legislation that ended up getting modified.but lets talk about taking on tough votes.', 'i mean, i am somebody who led on reforming a death penalty system that was broken in illinois, that nobody thought was good politics, but was the right thing to do.', '(applause)obama: i opposed legislation that now is being used against me politically to make sure that juveniles were not put in the criminal justice system as adults, even though it was not the smart thing to do politically.', 'it was not smart for me to oppose the war at the start of this war, but i did so because it was the right thing to do.', '(applause)obama: so i

okay, mr. president, thank you for doing this.president barack obama: great to be here, george.stephanopoulos: lets talk about isis to begin with.', 'did they bring down that russian plane?obama: well, we dont know that yet.', 'it is a possibilitystephanopoulos: just a possibility?obama: well, we dont know.', 'i think were still looking at all the details.', 'any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work.', 'it becomes more difficult when were not actively involved on the ground.', 'we are offering full cooperation with the egyptians, with the russians and others.', 'but a lot of this is peace work.', 'but theres a possibility that they may have taken place.stephanopoulos: a lot of the intelligence community seems to think its more of a probability.', 'adam schiff, the ranking democrat on house intelligence committee thinks it is.', 'and he told me last week that this would mean that isis has fully eclipsed al qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world.', 'is that right?obama: well, number one, i think its premature, but it is a possibility.', 'number two, what weve known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if theyve got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage.and this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the united states but overseas.', 'if theres a carrier coming here, then were working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that theyve got certain procedures.', 'now, we dont fly directly over the sinai to the united states, and as a consequence we dont have those same arrangements at those airports.but this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era.', 'and thats part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time theres an incident like this to see how this might have happened.stephanopoulos: but if isis with affiliates in so many countries right now, even afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, thats a game changer, isnt it?obama: well i have to tell you, george aqap in yemen al qaeda in yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner.', 'i think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they dont have to have a huge amount of personnel.', 'if theres a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it.', 'and they are looking for these cracks to exploit.what makes isil the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that theyre occupying territory in two countries that arent governed effectively in those spaces.', 'all right, so in iraq, when you get into the sunni areas of iraq theres not strong governance.', 'in syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order.', 'and their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have.stephanopoulos: do you think it meansobama: with respect to isil.stephanopoulos: that vladimir putin will start to take them on?obama: well putin, i think, from the start has been sincere in seeing isil as a threat.', 'the reason he went into syria is not primarily because of isil, but to prop up assad.', 'and part of our goal is to underscore for him and for everyone in the region that isil is the primary threat and you cant solve the isil problem if, in fact, youve got a country that is governed by somebody whos illegitimate and that the majority of syrians reject.stephanopoulos: big meeting this weekend.', 'can you convince him?obama: whats interesting is weve already seen i think a growing awareness on the part of the russians after several weeks now of fairly high paced bombing that theyre not going to win this militarily.', 'i think they understand that.', 'they may not admit it publicly, but youre already starting to see indications of that.and it is a modestly positive sign that theyve engaged with us, the saudis the turks and others to try to broker a political transition plan.', 'now, they have not yet come to the conclusion that assad cant be part of a new syria.', 'and i think its going to take some time for them to get there.', 'but our goal here, and john kerry, i thinks, done outstanding work in starting to create a platform and a set of principles whereby we agree that a political s solution is whats required, that it has to be inclusive, that theres going to be a transition phase.and, by bringing in the iranians and the russians, which is tough for us and tough for a number of our coalition allies theyre now at the table.', 'were starting to shape who are the groups that could responsibly govern syria.', 'and if we can keep pushing on that diplomatic track even as were squeezing isil in places like the sinjar operation thats currently taking place then what you see over the course of the next year is i think the possibility that our 60-member coalition and the approach that were taking is one that russia determines(overtalk)stephanopoulos: but the coalition hasnt all stepped up.', 'and some of your critics say, even your friendly critics say, like fareed zakaria, that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough.', 'every couple of months youre going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down.obama: i think what is true is that this has always been a multi-year project precisely because the governance structures in the sunni areas of iraq are weak, and there are none in syria.', 'and we dont have ground forces there in in sufficient numbers so simply march into al-raqqah in syria and clean the whole place out.', 'and as a consequence, weve always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining isils capabilities, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing at the same time as were putting a political track together in syria and fortifying the best impulses in baghdad so that we can, not just win militarily, but also win by improving governance(overtalk)stephanopoulos: and thats the strategy youve been following.', 'but isis is gaining strength, arent they?obama: well, no, i dont think theyre gaining strength.', 'what is true is that from the start our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them.', 'they have not gained ground in iraq.', 'and in syria it theyll come in, theyll leave.', 'but you dont see this systematic march by isil across the terrain.what we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures.', 'weve made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters.', 'but one of the things that ill be talking about when i see president erdogan in turkey and discuss this with the g20 is that weve still got to do more work in controlling the border so that the influx of foreign fighters is much more reduced.and you know, what we also have to do is frankly work with the iraqis to strengthen their capabilities.', 'because one of the big challenges throughout this campaign has been that the iraqi military has proven itself to be effective in protecting baghdad.', 'but its much harder for them, because theyre primarily shia, to move out into sunni areas.', 'and part of our goal has to be to recruit more effective sunni partners in iraq to really go on offense rather than simply engage in defense.stephanopoulos: so what do you think when you hear someone like ben carson get up in a debate and say, hey, this would be easy.', 'we can take isil out just by bombing their oil fields in anbar, thats what a general told him.obama: yeah.', 'what i think is that he doesnt know much about it.', 'and look george, i think its fair to say that over the last several years ive had access to all the best military minds in the country and all the best foreign policy minds in the country.', 'and im not running for office.', 'and so my only interest is in success.and if im down in the situation room talking with people who have worked in these regions and have run major military operations from the chairman of my joint chiefs of staff joe dunford to, you know, individuals like general allen, who was involved in iraqi operations back in 2007/2008, and they dont think its easy, then its probably not easy.and what weve been able to do is to shape a strategy that first and foremost contained the momentum that isil had gained.', 'we are now in a position where slowly, incrementally were pushing back against areas where we know weve got some solid partners like the kurds and the peshmerga.', 'but until we get the syria political situation resolved and until assad is no longer a lightning rod for sunnis in syria and the that entire region is not longer a proxy war for shia/sunni conflict were going to continue to have problemsstephanopoulos: that could take a generation.obama: well i would distinguish between making sure that the place is perfect.', 'thats not going to happen anytime soon with making sure that isil continues to shrink in its scope of operations until it no longer poses the kind of threat that it does, not just primarily to us, but to neighbors in the region like jordan or saudi arabia and that the humanitarian crisis thats taking place with millions of people who are fleeing the country that that can be relieved.stephanopoulos: youre not running for office.', 'but as you know, the republican candidates are putting your foreign policy on the ballot.', 'they say the obama/clinton legacy is a more dangerous world because youre weak and america has failed to lead.', 'if you were up on that stage, how would you respond?obama: well, what i would say is that america is not weaker; its stronger around the world than when i came into office.', 'and that can be measured by the influence that we have on a whole range of transnational issues, the cooperation that we get on not just counterterrorism, but on critical issues like climate change the work that were doing in asia that ill be traveling to talk about in terms of creating the kinds of rule based systems that preserve our freedom of navigation and try to push back against chinese efforts that may threaten the peace and prosperity of the region.you know, there was a lot of talk among these republicans about the success of putins strategy in the ukraine.', 'but in fact, because we were able to mobilize the entire international community, weve been able to you know, not only reduce the fighting in ukraine, but now were still on track to potentially resolve that peacefully.', 'so you know, one of the things thats striking to me, george, is that pub public opinion around the world about the united states is significantly higher than it was when i came into office.we have not seen the kinds of big threats against the united states that sadly we saw during something like 9/11.', 'weve been able to take more than 180,000 troops or 150, 60, 70,000 troops out of harms way while still maintaining coalition partnerships.', 'and in everywhere from latin america to africa we helped to shape the agenda for a more peaceful, prosperous world.', 'so when you hear rhetoric like this, george, about americas never been in greater danger thats rhetoric.', 'thats campaign talk.stephanopoulos: but when you think about it, when you reflect on it, where have you fallen short?', 'you didnt expect to have several thousand troops in afghanistan, more than 3,500 troops in iraq.obama: well, i think actually in afghanistan lets take afghanistan as an example.', 'i dont think any of us were ever under any illusion that we could withdraw every single troop out of afghanistan and that country, which is one of the poorest in the world, that has gone through 30 or 40 year so fighting would be completely stable.our very premise, our strategy was always that we were going to have to provide the kinds of advice the kinds of training, the kinds of military support that would be required so that this nascent democracy began to work.', 'and thats exactly what were doing.', 'i when i consider where we have fallen short, what is absolutely true is that in the middle east and in syria in particular the you know, enormous changes that took place post arab spring were ones that dont happen, you know, every ten years.', 'they happen every 50, 60, 70 years.', 'and we have not been able to get the kind of success on the ground with countries that were fragile to begin with that were governed by dictators to create the kind of civil society that would allow for a functioning, if not perfectly democratic, then at least civil society and government.and you know, thats humbling.', 'but its hard.', 'and when you hear the republicans talk about well, you know, wed go in and fix this right away.', 'were going to win in middle east.', 'whats clear is that you dont have any sense of how difficult it is.', 'and they dont have a lot of sense of history, including the recent history of our efforts in places like afghanistan and iraq.stephanopoulos: lot of talk about immigration as well.', 'donald trump is speaking about history.', 'he wants to bring back operation wetback from president eisenhower and deportation force.', 'what would that mean?obama: well, i think the name of the operation tells you something about the dangers of looking backwards.', 'and the notion that were going to deport 11, 12 million people from this country, first of all i have no idea where mr. trump thinks the moneys going to come from.', 'it would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that.', 'imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children and putting them in what, detention centers and then systematically sending them out.', 'nobody thinks that that is realistic, but more importantly, thats not who we are as americans.stephanopoulos: what do you think when you hear people cheer for that?obama: well, what i think is that theres always been a strain of anti-immigrant sentiment in america, ironically from folks who themselves two generations back or even one generation back were immigrants themselves.', 'and its the job of leaders not to play into that sentiment.', 'now, those sentiments get stronger when people feel insecure.and given what happened in 2007, 2008, given the fact that despite the recovery, i think people still have some post-traumatic stress and are still concerned about prospects for jobs and economic security in the future its easy to play on those fears.', 'but thats not thats not what you want from your president.and to their credit republican and as well as democratic senators and or presidents in the past, including ronald reagan, including george h.w.', 'bush, including george w. bush have understood that we are a nation of laws, but were also a nation of immigrants and that proposing radical and necessarily cruel solutions to a problem that can be solved by some good, old-fashioned legislation of the sort that passed on a bipartisan basis in the senate and i wouldve been able to sign two years ago if the house republicans had allowed it to come to the floor cause there was a majority on that floor to vote for it we dont want i think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears.stephanopoulos: you say were a nation of laws.', 'on the issue of guantanamo, one of your big promises, closing guantanamo speaker ryan says you cant close it on your own, dont have the authority.', 'he says the law is the law.', 'do you have the authority to close it on your own?obama: well, heres what i know is that we need to close it.', 'thats not just my opinion.', 'if you take a survey of retired generals folks who are currently in uniform they will tell you that this is a consistent recruitment tool for jihadists.', 'it is contrary to our values.', 'it costs huge amounts of money.', 'and its not sustainableobama: so it is my--stephanopoulos: did on your own.obama: so it is my job to, first and foremost, work with congress to try to find a solution.', 'and what weve been able to do during the course of this administration is to systematically transfer and draw down the numbers who are there.', 'my hope is that by the end of this year we are seeing close to under 100 prisoners remaining and detainees remaining.', 'and then my intention is to present to congress a sensible, plausible plan that will meet our national security needs and be consistent with who arestephanopoulos: and when they say no?obama: well they im not going to one of the things that ive been consistently trying to do is to give congress the chance to do the right thing before i then look at my next options.', 'and congress is going to have an opportunity, i think when they look at the numbers, when they look at how much it costs for us to detain these individuals, when they hear from both current and retired military officers who say this is not what we should be doing theyre going to have the ability to make their own assumptions.stephanopoulos: so youre not ruling out doing it on your own?obama: my job right now is to make sure that congress has a chance to look at a serious plan and look at all the facts and well take it from there.stephanopoulos: will you rule out executive action?obama: well take it from there.stephanopoulos: youve called hillary clinton a good friend, strong friend, one of americas finest secretaries of state and said shed make a great president.', 'so is it fair for democrats to conclude shes your candidate?obama: (laugh) george, im not going to make endorsements when, you know, ive said in the past its important for the process to play itself out.', 'i think dem i think hillarys doing great.', 'i think, you know, bernie sanders is really adding to this debate--stephanopoulos: would he make a great president?obama: -- in a very serious way.', 'you know, i think bernie is capturing a sense among the american people that they want to know the governments on their side, that its not bought and paid for, that you know, our focus has to be on hard working, middle class americans not getting a raw deal.', 'and i think that is in in incredibly important.', 'i think martin omalley has important things to say.', 'so well let this process play out.', 'i am confident that were going to have a good, strong democratic candidate, and that theyll be able to win in november.stephanopoulos: finally-- when you were a student, you spoke out, you protested apartheid in south africa.', 'if you were on the campus of university of missouri today, would you be a protestor?obama: (sigh) without knowing all the facts ive read enough to know that there is clearly a problem at-- the university of missouri.', 'and, thats not just coming from students.', 'thats coming from some faculty.', 'and i think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest-- what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst.', 'i want-- an activist student body just like i want an activist citizenry.', 'and-- the issue is just making sure that-- even as these young people are getting engaged, getting involved, speaking out-- that theyre also listening.', 'and, you know id rather see them err on the side of activism than being passive.', 'i think that what you saw with the university of missouri football team, and the coach, you know, standing up for something that they think is right-- harkens back to a powerful tradition that helped to bring about great change in this country.', 'but i also want to make sure that they understand that being a good citizen being an activist involves hearing the other side--stephanopoulos: see, thats what i wanted to ask you (crosstalk)obama: --and making sure that you are engaging in a dialogue, because thats also how change happens.', 'the civil rights movement happened because there was civil disobedience, because people were willing to get to go to jail, because there were events like bloody sunday.', 'but it was also because the leadership of the movement consistently stayed open to the possibility of reconciliation and sought to understand the views even views that were appalling to them of the other side.stephanopoulos: because there does seem to be a strain on some of these campuses of a kind of militant political correctness where you shut down the other side.obama: and i disagree with that.', 'and, its interesting.', 'you know, ive now got, you know, daughters who-- one is about to go to college-- the other ones-- you know, going to be on her way in a few years.', 'and then we talk about this at the dinner table.and i say to them, listen, if you hear somebody using a racial epithet, if you hear somebody whos anti-semitic, if you see an injustice, i want you to speak out.', 'and i want you to be firm and clear and i want you to protect people who may not have voices themselves.', 'i want you to be somebody whos strong and sees themselves as somebody whos looking out for the vulnerable.but i tell em-- i want you also to be able to listen.', 'i dont want you to think that a display of your strength is simply shutting other people up.', 'and that part of your ability to bring about change is going to be by engagement and understanding the viewpoints and the arguments of the other side.', 'and so when i hear, for example, you know, folks on college campuses saying, were not going to allow somebody to speak on our campus because we disagree with their ideas or we feel threatened by their ideas-- you know, i think thats a recipe for dogmatism.', 'and i think youre not going to be as effective.', 'and so, but i want to be clear here cause, and its a tough issue because, you know, there are two values that i care about.i care about civil rights and i care about kids not being discriminated against or having swastikas painted on their doors or nooses hung-- thinking its a joke.', 'i think its entirely appropriate for-- any institution, including universities, to say, dont walk around in black face.', 'it offends people.', 'dont wear a headdress and beat your chest if native american students have said, you know, this hurts us.', 'this bothers us.', 'theres nothing wrong with that.but we also have these values of free speech.', 'and its not free speech in the abstract.', 'the purpose of that kind of free speech is to make sure that we are forced to use argument and reason and words in making our democracy work.', 'and you know, the you dont have to be fearful of somebody spouting bad ideas.', 'just out-argue em, beat em.make the case as to why theyre wrong.', 'win over

stripping the state of the authority to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums and called on the department of health and human services to take a more active role in reviewing rates in florida.', 'the affordable care act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers.', 'while the federal government determined in early may that florida’s office of insurance regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on may 31, 2013 governor scott signed sb 1842 and explicitly forbid insurance commissioner kevin mccarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the marketplace for at least two years.in the letter, the representatives write that the premium increases are “not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by governor scott and the florida legislature to undermine the affordable care act and make health insurance premiums on the florida health insurance marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the insurance commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high….', 'it is our hope that hhs will intervene on behalf of florida consumers to ensure policies available on the marketplace are

office of insurance regulation operated an effective rate review program.', 'led by a state insurance commissioner, this office has long been charged by florida law to review proposed insurance

insurance plans offered on the new marketplace on behalf of florida consumers for at least two years.', 'in our view, the passage of this law invalidates cms’s determination that florida had an effective rate review program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in florida to protect consumers.indeed in other states, like maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have rate review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.over 3.9 million people in florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on florida’s new marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage.', 'this week, florida insurance commissioner kevin mccarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this october will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market.', 'this is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by governor scott and the florida legislature to undermine the affordable care act and make health insurance premiums on the florida health insurance marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the insurance commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high.', 'florida legislators also directed the office of insurance regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.while other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their marketplaces, officials in florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers.', 'the actions taken by governor scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.the affordable care act provides important

nut.one issue your democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the nra on some gun issues, cnn’s jake tapper said in a july 5 interview with sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-martin o’malley group.bernie sanders voted against the brady bill -- background checks and waiting periods, said the attack, which first aired june 25. bernie sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (bernie sanders, gun nut) as well as conservative glee (sorry liberals, bernie sanders is a gun nut).', 'so we wanted to take a look at his vote on the brady handgun violence prevention act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.the brady act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks.', '(after 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.', ')but before brady became law, it underwent many transformations.', 'sanders, elected to the house of representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:• in may 1991, sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the house.• the senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the house.', 'in nov. 1991, sanders voted against that version.', 'though it passed in the house, the senate didn’t muster enough votes.', 'the brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.• after some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period.', 'in november 1993, sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).• he also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.• the final compromise version of the brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on nov. 30, 1993. sanders voted against it.according to sanders campaign manager jeff weaver, sanders’ reason for opposing the brady bill was two-fold.', 'first, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach.', 'and second, he was doing his job.he wasnt opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to.', 'the republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and bernie voted that down, weaver said.', 'he said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of vermont.in april 1991, sanders’ then-chief of staff anthony pollina echoed the idea that sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives.', 'he was sent to washington to present all of vermont, pollina said.', 'it’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something vermonters have been very clear about.the green mountain state, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate).', 'that and sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.as a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically, explained bertram johnson, a professor of political science at middlebury college in vermont.', 'he seems to support more regulation of guns than the u.s. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.i think he has disappointed many progressives in vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years, said chris graff, the former vermont associated press bureau chief.', 'gun control is a tough issue in vermont for all politicians.former vermont gov.', 'howard dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the national rifle association.', 'vermont democratic sen. patrick leahy also voted against the brady bill.', 'for his part, sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect second amendment rights the other half.here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike.', 'former nra research coordinator paul blackman says the group doesn’t consider sanders an anti-gunner, and he’s received mixed marks from nra ranging from a c- to f. brady campaign president dan gross says sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first brady votes and added he isn’t a gun lobby lapdog.experts agreed that on guns, sanders’ views are to the right of his democratic rivals.when it comes to guns, he’s not ted cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than martin o’malley or hillary clinton, said eric davis, who studies vermont politics at middlebury college.', 'guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that bernie looks at politics through.our rulingan attack ad said,

midst of the great depression, president franklin delano roosevelt looked out at the nation and this is what he saw.he saw tens of millions of its citizens denied the basic necessities of life.he saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them day by day.he saw millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children.he saw millions lacking the means to buy the products they needed and by their poverty and lack of disposable income denying employment to many other millions.he saw one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.and he acted.', 'against the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day, people he called economic royalists, roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of people back to work, took them out of poverty and restored their faith in government.', 'he redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our country.', 'he combatted cynicism, fear and despair.', 'he reinvigorated democracy.', 'he transformed the country.and that is what we have to do today.and, by the way, almost everything he proposed was called “socialist.” social security, which transformed life for the elderly in this country was “socialist.” the concept of the “minimum wage” was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace and was described as “socialist.” unemployment insurance, abolishing child labor, the 40-hour work week, collective bargaining, strong banking regulations, deposit insurance, and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described, in one way or another, as “socialist.” yet, these programs have become the fabric of our nation and the foundation of the middle class.thirty years later, in the 1960s, president johnson passed medicare and medicaid to provide health care to millions of senior citizens and families with children, persons with disabilities and some of the most vulnerable people in this county.', 'once again these vitally important programs were derided by the right wing as socialist programs that were a threat to our american way of life.that was then.', 'now is now.today, in 2015, despite the wall street crash of 2008, which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the depression, the american people are clearly better off economically than we were in 1937.but, here is a very hard truth that we must acknowledge and address.', 'despite a huge increase in technology and productivity, despite major growth in the u.s. and global economy, tens of millions of american families continue to lack the basic necessities of life, while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimal standard of living for their families.', 'the reality is that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low.the rich get much richer.', 'almost everyone else gets poorer.', 'super pacs funded by billionaires buy elections.', 'ordinary people don’t vote.', 'we have an economic and political crisis in this country and the same old, same old establishment politics and economics will not effectively address it.if we are serious about transforming our country, if we are serious about rebuilding the middle class, if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy, we need to develop a political movement which, once again, is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation.', 'the billionaire class cannot have it all.', 'our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.we need to create a culture which, as pope francis reminds us, cannot just be based on the worship of money.', 'we must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts, while children in america go hungry and veterans sleep out on the streets.today, in america, we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but few americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth goes to the people on top.', 'in fact, over the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth – trillions of wealth – going from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent – a handful of people who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth they own over that period.unbelievably, and grotesquely, the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.today, in america, millions of our people are working two or three jobs just to survive.', 'in fact, americans work longer hours than do the people of any industrialized country.', 'despite the incredibly hard work and long hours of the american middle class, 58 percent of all new income generated today is going to the top one percent.today, in america, as the middle class continues to disappear, median family income, is $4,100 less than it was in 1999. the median male worker made over $700 less than he did 42 years ago, after adjusting for inflation.', 'last year, the median female worker earned more than $1,000 less than she did in 2007.today, in america, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings – zero – while millions of elderly and people with disabilities are trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year.', 'from vermont to california, older workers are scared to death.', '“how will i retire with dignity?,” they ask?today, in america, nearly 47 million americans are living in poverty and over 20 percent of our children, including 36 percent of african american children, are living in poverty — the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth.today, in america, 29 million americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles.', 'further, with the united states paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, 1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write.today, in america, youth unemployment and underemployment is over 35 percent.', 'meanwhile, we have more people in jail than any other country and countless lives are being destroyed as we spend $80 billion a year locking up fellow americans.the bottom line is that today in america we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality.', 'a handful of super-wealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process, while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in congress.in 1944, in his state of the union speech, president roosevelt outlined what he called a second bill of rights.', 'this is one of the most important speeches ever made by a president but, unfortunately, it has not gotten the attention that it deserves.in that remarkable speech this is what roosevelt stated, and i quote: “we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.', 'necessitous men are not free men.” end of quote.', 'in other words, real freedom must include economic security.', 'that was roosevelt’s vision 70 years ago.', 'it is my vision today.', 'it is a vision that we have not yet achieved.', 'it is time that we did.in that speech, roosevelt described the economic rights that he believed every american was entitled to: the right to a decent job at decent pay, the right to adequate food, clothing, and time off from work, the right for every business, large and small, to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies.', 'the right of all americans to have a decent home and decent health care.what roosevelt was stating in 1944, what martin luther king, jr. stated in similar terms 20 years later and what i believe today, is that true freedom does not occur without economic security.people are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family.', 'people are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity.', 'people are not truly free when they are unemployed or underpaid or when they are exhausted by working long hours.', 'people are not truly free when they have no health care.so let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me.', 'it builds on what franklin delano roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all americans.', 'and it builds on what martin luther king, jr. said in 1968 when he stated that; “this country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.” it builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor.democratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy.democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system in america today which is not only grossly unfair but, in many respects, corrupt.it is a system, for example, which during the 1990s allowed wall street to spend $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated.', 'then, ten years later, after the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior of wall street led to their collapse, it is a system which provided trillions in government aid to bail them out.', 'wall street used their wealth and power to get congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then, when their greed caused their collapse, they used their wealth and power to get congress to bail them out.', 'quite a system!and, then, to add insult to injury, we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail, the bankers were too big to jail.', 'kids who get caught possessing marijuana get police records.', 'wall street ceos who help destroy the economy get raises in their salaries.', 'this is what martin luther king, jr. meant by socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else.in my view, it’s time we had democratic socialism for working families, not just wall street, billionaires and large corporations.', 'it means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations, huge tax breaks for the very rich, or trade policies which boost corporate profits as workers lose their jobs.', 'it means that we create a government that works for works for all of us, not just powerful special interests.', 'it means that economic rights must be an essential part of what america stands for.it means that health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege.', 'this is not a radical idea.', 'it exists in every other major country on earth.', 'not just denmark, sweden or finland.', 'it exists in canada, france, germany and taiwan.', 'that is why i believe in a medicare-for-all single payer health care system.', 'yes.', 'the affordable care act, which i helped write and voted for, is a step forward for this country.', 'but we must build on it and go further.medicare for all would not only guarantee health care for all people, not only save middle class families and our entire nation significant sums of money, it would radically improve the lives of all americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy.people who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a co-payment.', 'they could go to the doctor when they should, and not end up in the emergency room.', 'business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they are going to provide health care for their employees.', 'workers will not have to be trapped in jobs they do not like simply because their employers are offering them decent health insurance plans.', 'instead, they will be able to pursue the jobs and work they love, which could be an enormous boon for the economy.', 'and by the way, moving to a medicare for all program will end the disgrace of americans paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.democratic socialism means that, in the year 2015, a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago – and that public education must allow every person in this country, who has the ability, the qualifications and the desire, the right to go to a public colleges or university tuition free.', 'this is also not a radical idea.', 'it exists today in many countries around the world.', 'in fact, it used to exist in the united states.democratic socialism means that our government does everything it can to create a full employment economy.', 'it makes far more sense to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, than to have a real unemployment rate of almost 10%.', 'it is far smarter to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for unemployed young people, than to lock them up and spend $80 billion a year through mass incarceration.democratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty: that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage – $15 an hour over the next few years.', 'it means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong paid family and medical leave legislation now in congress.', 'how can it possibly be that the united states, today, is virtually the only nation on earth, large or small, which does not guarantee that a working class woman can stay home for a reasonable period of time with her new-born baby?', 'how absurd is that?democratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet, and that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren.democratic socialism means, that in a democratic, civilized society the wealthiest people and the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes.', 'yes.', 'innovation, entrepreneurship and business success should be rewarded.', 'but greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support.', 'it is not acceptable that in a rigged economy in the last two years the wealthiest 15 americans saw their wealth increase by $170 billion, more wealth than is owned by the bottom 130 million americans.', 'let us not forget what pope francis has so elegantly stated; “we have created new idols.', 'the worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal.”it is not acceptable that major corporations stash their profits in the cayman islands and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying $100 billion in taxes each and every year.', 'it is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers.', 'it is not acceptable that billionaire families are able to leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable estate tax.', 'it is not acceptable that wall street speculators are able to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on those transactions.democratic socialism, to me, does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice.', 'it also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person one vote.', 'it is extremely sad that the united states, one of the oldest democracies on earth, has one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country, and that millions of young and working class people have given up on our political system entirely.', 'every american should be embarrassed that in our last national election 63% of the american people, and 80% of young people, did not vote.', 'clearly, despite the efforts of many republican governors to suppress the vote, we must make it easier for people to participate in the political process, not harder.', 'it is not too much to demand that everyone 18 years of age is registered to vote – end of discussion.further, it is unacceptable that we have a corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires, billionaires and large corporations to contribute as much as they want to super pacs to elect candidates who will represent their special interests.', 'we must overturn citizens united and move to public funding of elections.so the next time you hear me attacked as a socialist, remember this:i don’t believe government should own the means of production, but i do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of america deserve a fair deal.i believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in america instead of shipping jobs and profits overseas.i believe that most americans can pay lower taxes – if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should.i don’t believe in special treatment for the top 1%, but i do believe in equal treatment for african-americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that black lives matter.i despise appeals to nativism and prejudice, and i do believe in immigration reform that gives hispanics and others a pathway to citizenship and a better life.i don’t believe in some foreign “ism”, but i believe deeply in american idealism.i’m not running for president because it’s my turn, but because it’s the turn of all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some, not for the few, but for all.no one understood better than fdr the connection between american strength at home and our ability to defend america at home and across the world.', 'that is why he proposed a second bill of rights in 1944, and said in that state of the union:“america’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens.', 'for unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”i’m not running to pursue reckless adventures abroad, but to rebuild america’s strength at home.', 'i will never hesitate to defend this nation, but i will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pretenses or into dubious battles with no end in sight.and when we discuss foreign policy, let me join the people of paris in mourning their loss, and pray that those who have been wounded will enjoy a full recovery.', 'our hearts also go out to the families of the hundreds of russians apparently killed by an isis bomb on their flight, and those who lost their lives to terrorist attacks in lebanon and elsewhere.to my mind, it is clear that the united states must pursue policies to destroy the brutal and barbaric isis regime, and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing.', 'but we cannot – and should not – do it alone.our response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy.', 'it begins with the acknowledgment that unilateral military action should be a last resort, not a first resort, and that ill-conceived military decisions, such as the invasion of iraq, can wreak far-reaching devastation and destabilize entire regions for decades.', 'it begins with the reflection that the failed policy decisions of the past – rushing to war, regime change in iraq, or toppling mossadegh in iran in 1953, or guatemalan president árbenz in 1954, brazilian president goulart in 1964, chilean president allende in 1973. these are the sorts of policies do not work, do not make us safer, and must not be repeated.after world war ii, in response to the fear of soviet aggression, european nations and the united states established the north atlantic treaty organization – an organization based on shared interests and goals and the notion of a collective defense against a common enemy.', 'it is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror.we must create an organization like nato to confront the security threats of the 21st century – an organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism and importantly to address the root causes underlying these brutal acts.', 'we must work with our nato partners, and expand our coalition to include russia and members of the arab league.but let’s be very clear.', 'while the u.s. and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and political systems, the fight against isis is a struggle for the soul of islam, and countering violent extremism and destroying isis must be done primarily by muslim nations – with the strong support of their global partners.these same sentiments have been echoed by those in the region.', 'jordan’s king abdallah ii said in a speech on sunday that terrorism is the “greatest threat to our region” and that muslims must lead the fight against it.', 'he noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibility, and that it is incumbent on muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and generations with intolerance and violent ideology.and let me congratulate king abdallah not only for his wise remarks, but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific refugee crisis in the region.a new and strong coalition of western powers, muslim nations, and countries like russia must come together in a strongly coordinated way to combat isis, to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across, to share counter-terrorism intelligence, to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing, and to end support for exporting radical ideologies.what does all of this mean?', 'well, it means that, in many cases, we must ask more from those in the region.', 'while jordan, turkey, egypt, and lebanon have accepted their responsibilities for taking in syrian refugees, other countries in the region have done nothing or very little.equally important, and this is a point that must be made – countries in the region like saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, uae – countries of enormous wealth and resources – have contributed far too little in the fight against isis.', 'that must change.', 'king abdallah is absolutely right when he says that that the muslim nations must lead the fight against isis, and that includes some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region, who, up to this point have done far too little.saudi arabia has the 3rd largest defense budget in the world, yet instead of fighting isis they have focused more on a campaign to oust iran-backed houthi rebels in yemen.', 'kuwait, a country whose ruling family was restored to power by u.s. troops after the first gulf war, has been a well-known source of financing for isis and other violent extremists.', 'it has been reported that qatar will spend $200 billion on the 2022 world cup, including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event – $200 billion on hosting a soccer event, yet very little to fight against isis.', 'worse still, it has been widely reported that the government has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing, and that qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups, including al nusra and isis.all of this has got to change.', 'wealthy and powerful muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the united states to do their work for them.', 'as we develop a strongly coordinated effort, we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against isis takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation that we desperately need.further, we all understand that bashar al-assad is a brutal dictator who has slaughtered many of his own people.', 'i am pleased that we saw last weekend diplomats from all over world, known as the international syria support group, set a timetable for a syrian-led political transition with open and fair elections.', 'these are the promising beginnings of a collective effort to end the bloodshed and to move to political transition.the diplomatic plan for assad’s transition from power is a good step in a united front.', 'but our priority must be to defeat isis.', 'nations all over the world, who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorist, must make the destruction of isis the highest priority.', 'nations in the region must commit – that instead of turning a blind eye — they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorist finances and fighters to syria and iraq.', 'we need a commitment that they will counter the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism – rhetoric that often occurs within their very borders.this is the model in which we must pursue solutions to the sorts of global threats we face.while individual nations indeed have historic disputes – the u.s. and russia, iran and saudi arabia – the time is now to put aside those differences to work towards a common purpose of destroying isis.', 'sadly, as we have seen recently, no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization or those whom they have radicalized.thus, we must work with our partners in europe, the gulf states, africa, and southeast asia – all along the way asking the hard questions whether their actions are serving our unified purpose.the bottom line is that isis must be destroyed, but it cannot be defeated by the united states alone.', 'a new and effective coalition must be formed with the muslim nations leading the effort on the ground, while the united states and other major forces provide the support they need.']","['shouldbe universalwage freehealthcare 20hrworkweek freeuniversaleducation freeuniversalfoodwater

centered on a notorious pharmaceutical company who gave money to the clinton foundation in a bid to cover up their drug price gouging crimes.according to reports, ‘us federal grand jury had been impaneled to hear testimony from witnesses presented before it by fbi investigators and/or us attorneys’.on july 7th, the report continues, a massive explosion occurred that obliterated a two-story house.', 'the shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.‘as per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, svr analysts, in their replying to the mod’s request for information about this “event”, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion– carole paladino, age 72, and her husband john paladino, age 73—with, and very surprisingly to them, a svr database “target hit” on carole paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by svr analysts as being a “probable witness” against the clinton foundation.,‘now deceased carole paladino was the lead school nurse for millville public schools located in cumberland county, new jersey—and whose inclusion in the svr’s database of “potential witnesses” against the clinton foundation was due to her being a “central identified and named figure” in the creation of a document titled “training protocols for the emergency administration of epinephrine” for the new jersey department of education.’‘epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis—that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death—and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (epipen)—and that the carole paladino collaborated on report for its “emergency administration” led new jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their state, both public and private, to purchase it—and their passing another law allowing new jersey school nurses to, also, use epipens without parental permission.’‘whether knowingly, or not knowingly, carole paladino, by her being a “main target” person in the plot to force all new jersey schools to purchase epipens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in us history—that began when the american global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company mylan n.v. suddenly began funneling money to the clinton foundation—and that nearly immediately after which, saw gayle conelly manchin take over as the head of the national association of state boards of education—and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged states to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions—that, in turn, helped pave the way for mylan n.v., maker of epipens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses’ offices throughout the united states—with new jersey is one of the 11 states drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools—and that the obama-clinton regime conspired with using their “epipen law” that gave funding preference to states that did what gayle conelly manchin told them to do.’‘unbeknownst to the american people, this report notes, is that gayle conelly manchin is the mother of heather bresch—who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the national association of state boards of education and began her campaign to force schools to buy epipens—became the ceo of epipen maker mylan n.v.—with heather bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of epipens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million—and whose “protection” for this vile plot was provided by her father, and gayle conelly manchin’s husband, democratic party us senator joe manchin.’‘to an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting hillary clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her epipen one, this report further notes, is her “active and knowing” participation in the united states opioid crisis—that the centers for disease control and prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the us have increased by 13.3 percent from august 2016 to august 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year—nearly all of which were deliberately caused by oxycontin-maker purdue pharma—who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the clinton foundation, saw the obama-clinton regime to a “blind eye” to their flooding of america with opioids—and as exampled by democratic party us senator joe manchin’s home state of west virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his state.’‘this report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in america, concludes with svr analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the fbi task force investigating hillary clinton and her clinton foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of tennessee—and that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in knoxville, tennessee—that was brought against the clinton foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant purdue pharma by tennessee attorney general herbert h. slatery iii on behalf of the citizens of his state—and whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:“purdue’s own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of oxycontin but created a false narrative – that long-term use of opioids didn’t create addicts but instead caused “pseudo addictive” symptoms.the groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids.', 'tennessee’s legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.purdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher “quality of life.”the firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how oxycontin – purdue’s financial rainmaker – was better for patients than other opioids on the market.”credit: the event chronicle  clinton body count series:

striking.sen.', 'clinton: well, this is a contested campaign.', 'and as i have said many times, i have a great deal of respect for senator obama, but we have differences.', 'and in the last several days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that senator obamas campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on nafta have been very disturbing to me.and therefore, i think its important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision.you know, for example, its been unfortunate that senator obama has consistently said that i would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not.', 'you know, health care reform and achieving universal health care is a passion of mine.', 'it is something i believe in with all my heart.', 'and every day that im campaigning, and certainly here throughout ohio, ive met so many families -- happened again this morning in lorain -- who are just devastated because they dont get the health care they deserve to have.', 'and unfortunately its a debate we should have that is accurate and is based in facts about my plan and senator obamas plan, because my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable.', 'and on many occasions, independent experts have concluded exactly that.and senator obamas plan does not cover everyone.', 'it would leave, give or take, 15 million people out.', 'so we should have a good debate that uses accurate information, not false, misleading, and discredited information, especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality, affordable health care for everyone.', 'thats my goal.', 'thats what im fighting for, and im going to stand up for that.mr.', 'williams: on the topic of accurate information, and to that end, one of the things that has happened over the past 36 hours -- a photo went out the website the drudge report, showing senator obama in the native garb of a nation he was visiting, as you have done in a host country on a trip overseas.matt drudge on his website said it came from a source inside the clinton campaign.', 'can you say unequivocally here tonight it did not?advertisement continue reading the main storysen.', 'clinton: well, so far as i know, it did not.', 'and i certainly know nothing about it and have made clear that thats not the kind of behavior that i condone or expect from the people working in my campaign.', 'but we have no evidence where it came from.so i think that its clear what i would do if it were someone in my campaign, as i have in the past: asking people to leave my campaign if they do things that i disagree with.mr.', 'williams: senator obama, your response.sen.', 'obama: well, first of all, i take senator clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo.', 'so i think thats something that we can set aside.i do want to focus on the issue of health care because senator clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate.', 'now, keep in mind that i have consistently said that senator clintons got a good health care plan.', 'i think i have a good health care plan.', 'i think mine is better, but i have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar.i have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from senator clinton in iowa, in nevada and other places suggesting that i want to leave 15 million people out.according to senator clinton, that is accurate.', 'i dispute it, and i think it is inaccurate.', 'on the other hand, i dont fault senator clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan.the reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate.', 'that is not a mandate for the government to provide coverage to everybody; it is a mandate that every individual purchase health care.and the mailing that we put out accurately indicates that the main difference between senator clintons plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care.advertisement continue reading the main storyif it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as theyve done in massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out.', 'and if thats the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate.now, senator clinton has not indicated how she would enforce this mandate.', 'she hasnt indicated what level of subsidy she would provide to assure that it was, in fact, affordable.', 'and so it is entirely legitimate for us to point out these differences.but i think its very important to understand the context of this, and that is that senator clinton has -- her campaign, at least -- has constantly sent out negative attacks on us, e-mail, robocalls, flyers, television ads, radio calls.and, you know, we havent whined about it because i understand thats the nature of these campaigns, but to suggest somehow that our mailing is somehow different from the kinds of approaches that senator clinton has taken throughout this campaign i think is simply not accurate.mr.', 'williams: and senator clinton, on this subject --sen. clinton: but i have to -- i have to respond to that because this is not just any issue, and certainly weve had a vigorous back and forth on both sides of our campaign.', 'but this is an issue that goes to the heart of whether or not this country will finally do what is right, and that is to provide quality affordable health care to every single person.senator obama has a mandate in his plan.', 'its a mandate on parents to provide health insurance for their children.', 'thats about 150 million people who would be required to do that.', 'the difference between senator obama and myself is that i know, from the work ive done on health care for many years, that if everyones not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do whats called cherry picking -- pick those who get insurance and leave others out.we will continue to have a hidden tax, so that when someone goes to the emergency room without insurance -- 15 million or however many -- that amount of money that will be used to take care of that person will be then spread among all the rest of us.and most importantly, you know, the kind of attack on my health care plan, which the university of pennsylvania and others have said is misleading -- that attack goes right to the heart of whether or not we will be able to achieve universal health care.', 'thats a core democratic party value.', 'its something that ever since harry truman we have stood for.advertisement continue reading the main storyand what i find regrettable is that in senator obamas mailing that he has sent out across ohio, it is almost as though the health insurance companies and the republicans wrote it, because in my plan there is enough money, according to the independent experts whove evaluated it, to provide the kind of subsidies so that everyone would be able to afford it.', 'it is not the same as a single state trying to do this, because the federal government has many more resources at its disposal.sen.', 'obama (?', '): (inaudible.)sen.', 'clinton: so i think its imperative that we stand as democrats for universal health care.', 'ive staked out a claim for that.', 'senator edwards did.', 'others have.', 'but senator obama has not.mr.', 'williams: senator obama, a quick response.sen.', 'obama: well, look, i believe in universal health care, as does senator clinton.', 'and this is -- this is, i think, the point of the debate, is that senator clinton repeatedly claims that i dont stand for universal health care.', 'and, you know, for senator clinton to say that, i think, is simply not accurate.every expert has said that anybody who wants health care under my plan will be able to obtain it.', 'president clintons own secretary of labor has said that my plan does more to reduce costs and as a consequence makes sure that the people who need health care right now all across ohio, all across texas, rhode island, vermont, all across america, will be able to obtain it.', 'and we do more to reduce costs than any other plan thats been out there.now, i have no objection to senator clinton thinking that her approach is superior, but the fact of the matter is, is that if, as weve heard tonight, we still dont know how senator clinton intends to enforce a mandate, and if we dont know the level of subsidies that shes going to provide, then you can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still cant afford it, even with the subsidies.and they are then worse off.', 'they then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that.mr.', 'williams: thank you.sen.', 'obama: that is a genuine difference between myself and senator clinton.and the last point i would make is, the insurance companies actually are happy to have a mandate.', 'the insurance companies dont mind making sure that everybody has to purchase their product.', 'thats not something theyre objecting to.', 'the question is, are we going to make sure that it is affordable for everybody?', 'and thats my goal when im president of the united states.advertisement continue reading the main storymr.', 'williams: senator, as you two --sen. clinton: you know, brian -- brian, wait a minute.', 'ive got -- this is too important.you know, senator obama has a mandate.', 'he would enforce the mandate by requiring parents to buy insurance for their children.sen.', 'obama: this is true.sen.', 'clinton: that is the case.if you have a mandate, it has to be enforceable.', 'so theres no difference here.sen.', 'obama: no, there is a difference.sen.', 'clinton: its just that i know that parents who get sick have terrible consequences for their children.', 'so you can insure the children, and then youve got the bread-winner who cant afford health insurance or doesnt have it for him or herself.and in fact, it would be as though franklin roosevelt said lets make social security voluntary -- thats -- you know, thats -- lets let everybody get in it if they can afford it -- or if president johnson said lets make medicare voluntary.sen.', 'obama: well, let me --sen. clinton: what we have said is that at the point of employment, at the point of contact with various government agencies, we would have people signed up.', 'its like when you get a 401(k), its your employer.', 'the employer automatically enrolls you.', 'you would be enrolled.and under my plan, it is affordable because, number one, we have enough money in our plan.', 'a comparison of the plans like the ones were proposing found that actually i would cover nearly everybody at a much lower cost than senator obamas plan because we would not only provide these health care tax credits, but i would limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for a premium to a low percentage of your income.', 'so it will be affordable.now, if you want to say that we shouldnt try to get everyone into health insurance, thats a big difference, because i believe if we dont have universal health care, we will never provide prevention.advertisement continue reading the main storyi have the most aggressive measures to reduce costs and improve quality.', 'and time and time again, people who have compared our two approaches have concluded that.sen.', 'obama: brian, im sorry.sen.', 'clinton: so lets -- lets have a debate about the facts.sen.', 'obama: im going to get filibuttered -- im getting filibustered a little bit here.mr.', 'williams: the last answer on this topic.sen.', 'obama: i mean, it is just not accurate to say that senator clinton does more to control costs than mine.', 'that is not the case.', 'there are many experts who have concluded that she does not.i do provide a mandate for children, because, number one, we have created a number of programs in which we can have greater assurance that those children will be covered at an affordable price.', 'on the -- on the point of many adults, we dont want to put in a situation in which, on the front end, we are mandating them, we are forcing them to purchase insurance, and if the subsidies are inadequate, the burden is on them, and they will be penalized.', 'and that is what senator clintons plan does.now, i am -- i am happy to have a discussion with senator clinton about how we can both achieve the goal of universal health care.', 'what i do not accept -- and which is what senator clinton has consistently done and in fact the same experts she cites basically say theres no real difference between our plans, that are -- that they are not substantial.but it has to do with how we are going to achieve universal health care.', 'that is an area where i believe that if we make it affordable, people will purchase it.', 'in fact, medicare part b is not mandated, it is voluntary.', 'and yet people over 65 choose to purchase it, hillary, and the reason they choose to purchase it is because its a good deal.', 'and if people in cleveland or anywhere in ohio end up seeing a plan that is affordable for them, i promise you they are snatching it up because they are desperate to get health care.', 'and thats what i intend to provide as president of the united states.mr.', 'williams: senator, im going to change the subject.sen.', 'clinton: about 20 percent of -- about 20 percent of the people who are uninsured have the means to buy insurance.', 'theyre often young people --mr. williams: senator --sen. clinton: -- who think theyre immortal --sen. obama: which is why i cover them.advertisement continue reading the main storysen.', 'clinton: -- except when the illness or the accident strikes.', 'and what senator obama has said,

for six years of my first term i have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president i will have a lot more tools at my disposal.', 'and the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- i mean, this is not a big leap.', 'twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the clinton administration under my husband.', 'we can create at least 5 million new jobs.im not just talking about it.', 'i helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs.', 'i want to see people throughout ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and i know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the democrats wanted, as i originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those.you know, take a country like germany.', 'they made a big bet on solar power.', 'they have a smaller economy and population than ours.theyve created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that cant be outsourced.', 'these are jobs that have to be done in youngstown, in dayton, in cincinnati.', 'these are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through.', 'so i do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years.mr.', 'russert: brian?mr.', 'williams: senator obama, yesterday senator clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and im going to read you a quote from it.', 'quote, weve seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security.', 'we cannot let that happen again.', 'america has already taken that chance one time too many.', 'some of the comments in the speech were more pointed.', 'the senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of george w. bush at the same period.', 'provided you could be going into a general election against a republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair?sen.', 'obama: well, senator clinton i think equates experience with longevity in washington.', 'i dont think the american people do and i dont think that if you look at the judgments that weve made over the last several years that thats the accurate measure.', 'on the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into iraq -- i was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-american sentiment -- that it would distract us from afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and i do not believe it has made us more safe.al qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that john mccain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both senator clinton and i are talking about.', 'so on pakistan, during the summer i suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern pakistan.advertisement continue reading the main storyand many people said at the time well, you cant target those terrorists because musharraf is our ally and we dont want to offend him.', 'in fact, what we had was neither stability in pakistan nor democracy in pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in pakistan we would be much further along now than we are.', 'so on the critical issues that actually matter i believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that i think has been superior to senator clintons as well as senator mccains.mr.', 'williams: well, senator clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not senator obama was qualified to be commander in chief.', 'is your contention in this latest speech that america would somehow be taking a chance on senator obama as commander in chief?sen.', 'clinton: well, i have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in northern ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to beijing and standing up for womens rights as human rights and so much else.', 'and every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, senator obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. hes to be commended for having given the speech.', 'many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didnt have responsibility, he didnt have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way george bush was conducting the war.', 'and when he came to the senate, he and i have voted exactly the same.', 'we have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently.', 'so the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasnt just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference?', 'where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war?and on a number of other issues, i just believe that, you know, as senator obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan, which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take.', 'i have long advocated a much tougher approach to musharraf and to pakistan, and have pushed the white house to do that.and i disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it.so i think youve got to look at, you know, what i have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the senate armed services committee for now five years.', 'and i think that, you know, standing on that stage with senator mccain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, i will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really america must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country.mr.', 'williams: senator obama, a quick response.sen.', 'obama: let me just follow up.', 'my objections to the war in iraq were simply -- not simply a speech.', 'i was in the midst of a u.s. senate campaign.', 'it was a high-stakes campaign.', 'i was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and i was very specific as to why.and so when i bring this up, it is not simply to say i told you so, but it is to give you an insight in terms of how i would make decisions.advertisement continue reading the main storyand the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder.', 'it was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then weve voted the same way.', 'once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out.', 'the question is, whos making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch?', 'and the fact is that senator clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to george bush on day one on this critical issue.', 'so the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we cant afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the united states of america.with respect to pakistan, i never said i would bomb pakistan.', 'what i said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin laden or other key al qaeda officials, and we -- and pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should.', 'and just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al qaeda official.that is the position that we should have taken in the first place.', 'and president musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we dont know how the new legislature in pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy.and so my claim is not simply based on a speech.', 'it is based on the judgments that ive displayed during the course of my service on the senate foreign relations committee, while ive been in the united states senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, i think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against bush and cheney.', 'and that is how were going to be able to debate john mccain.', 'having a debate with john mccain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, i think, does not put you in a strong position.tim russert.sen.', 'clinton: well, i guess that --mr. russert: let me talk about the future -- let me talk the future about iraq, because this is important, i think, to democratic voters particularly.', 'you both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from iraq.', 'you both have said youd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al qaeda, to neutralize iran.', 'if the iraqi government said, president clinton or president obama, youre pulling out your troops this quickly?youre going to be gone in a year, but youre going to leave a residual force behind?', 'no.', 'get out.', 'get out now.', 'if you dont want to stay and protect us, were a sovereign nation.', 'go home now.', 'will you leave?sen.', 'obama: well, if the iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there.', 'this is a sovereign government, as george bush continually reminds us.now, i think that we can be in a partnership with iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of iraqis and to meet our national security interests.but in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why i have said that as soon as i take office, i will call in the joint chiefs of staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in.', 'we will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed.', 'we will provide them continued support.', 'but it is important for us not to be held hostage by the iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, thats distracting us from afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in america that will make us more competitive and more safe.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, if the iraqis said im sorry, were not happy with this arrangement; if youre not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'and i believe that there is no military solution that the americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the iraqi government.', 'and --mr. russert: let me ask -- let me ask you this, senator.', 'i want to ask you --sen. clinton: and they need to take responsibility for themselves.', 'and --mr. russert: i want to ask both of you this question, then.', 'if we -- if this scenario plays out and the americans get out in total and al qaeda resurges and iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as american president, to re-invade, to go back into iraq to stabilize it?sen.', 'clinton: you know, tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals.', 'and i believe that whats --mr. russert: but this is reality.sen.', 'clinton: no -- well, it isnt reality.', 'youre -- youre -- youre making lots of different hypothetical assessments.i believe that it is in americas interests and in the interests of the iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal.', 'ive been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and ive been pushing them to actually do it.', 'ive also said that i would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that i asked begun to be put together as soon as i became president.and i think we can take out one to two brigades a month.', 'ive also been a leader in trying to prevent president bush from getting us committed to staying in iraq regardless for as long as senator mccain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.so, when you talk about what we need to do in iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of america.', 'and i believe this is in the best interest.but i also have heard senator obama refer continually to afghanistan, and he references being on the foreign relations committee.', 'he chairs the subcommittee on europe.', 'it has jurisdiction over nato.', 'nato is critical to our mission in afghanistan.', 'hes held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato in afghanistan.you have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, i want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee.', 'but also, do you reserve a right as american president to go back into iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?sen.', 'obama: well, first of all, i became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. so it is true that we havent had oversight hearings on afghanistan.newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.', 'invalid email address.', 'please

allies to put more troops into afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in iraq and i think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in afghanistan in part because of whats happened in iraq.now, i always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, i will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for american interests.', 'and if al qaeda is forming a base in iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the american homeland and our interests abroad.', 'so that is true, i think, not just in iraq, but thats true in other places.', 'thats part of my argument with respect to pakistan.i think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in making sure that we are rooting out terrorist organizations, but if they are planning attacks on americans, like what happened in 9/11, it is my job -- it will be my job as president to make sure that we are hunting them down.mr.', 'williams: and senator, i need to reserve --sen. clinton: well, but i have -- i just have to add --mr. williams: im sorry, senator, ive got to --sen. clinton: now wait a minute, i have to add --mr. williams: ive got to get us to a break because television doesnt stop.sen.', 'clinton: -- because the question -- the question was about invading -- invading -- iraq.mr.',

-- (laughter, applause) -- of all the charges and countercharges made tonight, we can confirm that is not you, senator obama.sen.', 'obama: (chuckles.)mr.', 'williams: that was senator clinton.', 'but since we played that tape, albeit in error, for this segment, how did you take that?sen.', 'clinton: (laughs.)(laughter.)mr.', 'williams: how did you take those remarks when you heard them?sen.', 'obama: well, i thought senator clinton showed some good humor there.', 'i would give her points for delivery.sen.', 'clinton: (laughs.)(laughter.)sen.', 'obama: look, i understand the broader point that senator clintons been trying to make over the last several weeks.', 'you know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action.', 'and as i said in the last debate, ive spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and theyre seeking out the american dream.', 'thats how i started my career in public service, thats how i brought democrats and republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, thats how i helped to reform a welfare system that wasnt working in illinois, thats how ive provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so im very proud of that track record.and if senator clinton thinks that its all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at walter reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before i got to the senate.', 'and i changed that law.', 'or talk to those folks who i think have recognized that special interests are dominating washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in ohio.and so when i pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists cant get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of congress and they have to disclose who theyre getting money from and who theyre bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families.just one point ill make, i was in cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one.', 'and these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they dont have health care.', 'one of them doesnt have a job.', 'one of them is looking after an aging parent.', 'two of them were looking after disabled children.', 'one of them was dipping into their retirement accounts because she had been put on disability on the job.', 'and you hear these stories and what you realize is nobody has been listening to them.', 'that is not who george bush or dick cheney has been advocating for over the last seven years.and so i am not interested in talk.', 'i am not interested in speeches.', 'i would not be running if i wasnt absolutely convinced that i can put an economic agenda forward that is going to provide them with health care, is going to make college more affordable, and is going to get them the kinds of help that they need not to solve all their problems, but at least to be able to achieve the american dream.mr.', 'williams: well, let me ask you, senator clinton: what did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, i was having a little fun.', 'you know, its hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.but the larger point is that i know trying to get health insurance for every american thats affordable will not be easy.', 'its not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody its the right thing to do.', 'you know, 15 years ago i tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and i know it takes a fighter.', 'it takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests.you know, i have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies.', 'these have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the white house did, but because members of congress went along.', 'and i want to get that money back and invest it in the american middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout ohio, because what i hear as i go from toledo to parma to cleveland to, you know, dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but theyre not getting ahead.', 'they feel like theyre invisible to their government.', 'so when it came time to vote on dick cheneys energy bill, i voted no, and senator obama voted yes.', 'when it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which i think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- i voted yes and senator obama voted no.mr.', 'williams: and senator -- senator --sen. clinton: so part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight.', 'and i believe that i am a fighter, and i will fight for the people of ohio and the people of america.mr.', 'williams: what i was attempting to do here is to show something senator obama said about you, and im told its ready.mr.', 'russert: lets try it.mr.', 'williams: lets try it.', 'hang on.', 'watch your monitor.lets try it.', 'were going to come back to you.sen.', 'obama: but im going to have an opportunity to respond to this.sen.', 'obama: (from videotape.)', '-- herself as co-president during the clinton years.', 'every good thing that happened she says she was a part of.', 'and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.mr.', 'williams: now, senator obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but ive been wanting to ask you about this assertion that senator clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president.sen.', 'obama: well, i think what is absolutely true is, is that when senator clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, heres what i did.heres what we did.', 'heres what we accomplished -- which is fine.and i have not -- i have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and i dont begrudge her claiming that as experience.', 'what ive said, and what i would continue to maintain, is you cant take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like nafta, you say, well, i -- behind the scenes, i was disagreeing.', 'that doesnt work.', 'so you have to, i think, take both responsibility as well as credit.now there are several points that i think senator clinton made that i -- we need to discuss here.', 'first of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards.', 'keep in mind, i objected to the entire bill -- a bill that senator clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for.', 'and in one of the debates with you guys said, well, i voted for it, but i hoped it wouldnt pass -- which, as a general rule, doesnt work.', 'if you dont want it to pass, you vote against it.', '(laughter.', ')you know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care.', 'and look -- i do not in any way doubt that senator clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all americans.what i have said is that the way she approached it back in 93, i think, was wrong in part because she had the view that whats required is simply to fight.', 'and senator clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party.', 'and as a consequence, there were a number of people, like jim cooper of tennessee and bill bradley and pat moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations.', 'and we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done.i am absolutely clear that hope is not enough.', 'and it is not going to be easy to pass health care.', 'if it was, it would have already gotten done.', 'its not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country.', 'exxonmobil made $11 billion last quarter.', 'they are not going to give up those profits easily.but what i also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, were going to have to mobilize and inspire the american people so that theyre paying attention to what their government is doing.', 'and thats what ive been doing in this campaign, and thats what i will do as president.and theres nothing romantic or silly about that.', 'if the american people are activated, thats how change is going to happen.the second thing weve going to have to do is were actually going to have to go after the special interests.senator clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you cant just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away.', 'that is absolutely true, but it doesnt help if youre taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests.', 'they are less likely to go away.so it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence congress.', 'and yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the american people to get involved and pay attention.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word.', 'nothing more important.', 'last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out.', 'you checked yes on a questionnaire.', 'and now senator mccain has said, calling your bluff, lets do it.', 'you seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here.why wont you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election?sen.', 'obama: tim, i am not yet the nominee.', 'now, what ive said is, is that when i am the nominee, if i am the nominee -- because weve still got a bunch of contests left and senator clintons a pretty tough opponent.', 'if i am the nominee, then i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes.senator mccain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people arent exactly clear whether all the ts were crossed and the is were dotted.now what i want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign.', 'i said very early on i would not take pac money.', 'i would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists.', 'that -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because i had confidence that the american people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign.we have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50.', 'we average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the american people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody whos interested in good government and politics supports.mr.', 'russert: so you may opt out of public financing.', 'you may break your word.sen.', 'obama: what i -- what i have said is, at the point where im the nominee, at the point where its appropriate, i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility.', 'you have loaned your campaign $5 million.', 'you and your husband file a joint return.', 'you refuse to release that joint return, even though former president clinton has had significant overseas business dealings.your chief supporter here in ohio, governor strickland, made releasing his opponents tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, accountability, transparency.', 'if hes not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding?', 'we should question whats going on.why wont you release your tax return, so the voters of ohio, texas, vermont, rhode island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, the american people who support me are bankrolling my campaign.', 'thats -- thats obvious.', 'you can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that ive gotten.', 'and ever since i lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously.', 'im thrilled at so many people getting involved.', 'and were raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the internet.', 'and if anybodys out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to hillaryclinton.com, because thats whos funding my campaign.and i will release my tax returns.', 'i have consistently said that.', 'and i will --mr. russert: why not now?sen.', 'clinton: well, i will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, tim, because i have been as open as i can be.you have -- the public has 20 years of records for me, and i have very extensive filings with the senate where --mr. russert: so, before next tuesdays primary?sen.', 'clinton: well, i cant get it together by then, but i will certainly work to get it together.', 'im a little busy right now; i hardly have time to sleep.', 'but i will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain.mr.', 'russert: one other issue.', 'you talked about releasing documents.', 'on january 30th, the national archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady.', 'its now in the custody of former president clinton.', 'will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'ive urged that the process be as quick as possible.', 'its a cumbersome process, set up by law.', 'it doesnt just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position.', 'and i have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can.', 'now, also, president bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and i would urge the bush white house to move as quickly as possible.mr.', 'russert: but youve had it for more than a month.', 'will you get to him -- will you get it to the white house immediately?sen.', 'clinton: as soon as we can, tim.', 'ive urged that, and i hope it will happen.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments.on sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, chicago tribune: louis farrakhan backs obama for president at nation of islam convention in chicago.', 'do you accept the support of louis farrakhan?sen.', 'obama: you know, i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti-semitic comments.', 'i think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible.', 'i did not solicit this support.', 'he expressed pride in an african-american who seems to be bringing the country together.', 'i obviously cant censor him, but it is not support that i sought.', 'and were not doing anything, i assure you, formally or informally with minister farrakhan.mr.', 'russert: do you reject his support?sen.', 'obama: well, tim, you know, i cant say to somebody that he cant say that he thinks im a good guy.', '(laughter.)', 'you know, i -- you know, i -- i have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and i think that indicates to the american people what my stance is on those comments.mr.', 'russert: the problem some voters may have is, as you know, reverend farrakhan called judaism gutter religion.obama: tim, i think -- i am very familiar with his record, as are the american people.', 'thats why i have consistently denounced it.this is not something new.', 'this is something that -- i live in chicago.', 'he lives in chicago.', 'ive been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate.', 'and i have consistently distanced myself from him.russert: the title of one of your books, audacity of hope, you acknowledge you got from a sermon from reverend jeremiah wright, the head of the trinity united church.', 'he said that louis farrakhan epitomizes greatness.he said that he went to libya in 1984 with louis farrakhan to visit with moammar gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, your jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in hell.russert: what do you do to assure jewish-americans that, whether its farrakhans support or the activities of reverend jeremiah wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding israel and not in any way suggesting that farrakhan epitomizes greatness?obama: tim, i have some of the strongest support from the jewish community in my hometown of chicago and in this presidential campaign.', 'and the reason is because i have been a stalwart friend of israels.', 'i think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and i think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the united states is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the jewish community.and the reason that i have such strong support is because they know that not only would i not tolerate anti-semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what i want to do is rebuild what i consider to be a historic relationship between the african-american community and the jewish community.you know, i would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of jewish americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the south.', 'and that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened.but, you know, the reason that i have such strong support in the jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my u.s. senate campaign and its true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that i consistently have not only befriended the jewish community, not only have i been strong on israel, but, more importantly, ive been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable.when i was -- just last point i would make -- when i was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at ebenezer baptist church in conjunction with martin luther kings birthday in front of a large african-american audience, i specifically spoke out against anti- semitism within the african-american community.', 'and thats what gives people confidence that i will continue to do that when im president of the united states.williams: senator...clinton: i just want to add something here, because i faced a similar situation when i ran for the senate in 2000 in new york.', 'and in new york, there are more than the two parties, democratic and republican.', 'and one of the parties at that time, the independence party, was under the control of people who were anti-semitic, anti- israel.', 'and i made it very clear that i did not want their support.', 'i rejected it.', 'i said that it would not be anything i would be comfortable with.', 'and it looked as though i might pay a price for that.', 'but i would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either israel or jewish people in our country.and, you know, i was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of new york supported me and i won.', 'but at the time, i thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that.russert: are you suggesting senator obama is not standing on principle?clinton: no.', 'im just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it.', 'and theres a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'and i think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- i have no doubt that everything that barack just said is absolutely sincere.', 'but i just think, weve got to be even stronger.', 'we cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching.obama: tim, i have to say i dont see a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'theres no formal offer of help from minister farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it.', 'but if the word reject senator clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce, then im happy to concede the point, and i would reject and denounce.clinton: good.', 'good.', 'excellent.', '(applause)williams: rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing.were going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks.', 'well be back live from cleveland right after this.', '(commercial break)williams: we are back from cleveland state university.', 'we continue with our debate.the question beginning this segment is for you, senator obama.the national journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of ted kennedy.in a general election, going up against a republican party, looking for converts, republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than ted kennedy?obama: well, first of all, lets take a look at what the national journal rated us on.it turned out that senator clinton and i had differences on two votes.', 'the first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldnt go back, and i thought it was bad policy.the second -- and this, i think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- i supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the senate, because i thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the senate, that they werent being investigated by the senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it.this is something that ive tried to push as part of my ethics package.obama: it was rejected.', 'and according to the national journal, that position is a liberal position.now, i dont think thats a liberal position.', 'i think there are a lot of republicans and a lot of independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated.', 'so the categories dont make sense.and part of the reason i think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that senator obamas campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more independent votes than any other candidate in the democratic primary, and republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head?', 'its because people dont want to go back to those old categories of whats liberal and whats conservative.they want to see who is making sense, whos fighting for them, whos going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense?', 'thats what ive been doing, and thats why, you know, the proof is in the pudding.', 'weve been attracting more independent and republican support than anybody else, and thats why every poll shows that right now i beat john mccain in a match-up in the general election.williams: lets go from domestic to foreign affairs and tim russert.russert: before the primary on tuesday, on sunday, march 2, theres an election in russia for the successor to president putin.', 'what can you tell me about the man whos going to be mr. putins successor?clinton: well, i can tell you that hes a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by putin, who putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know.', 'you know, theres a lot of information still to be acquired.', 'that the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against putins hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising putin.', 'so this is a clever but transparent way for putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how were going to deal with russia going forward.i have been very critical of the bush administration for what i believe to have been an incoherent policy toward russia.', 'and with the reassertion of russias role in europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting irans nuclear ambitions, for example, its imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward russia.', 'but i have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by putin.russert: who will it be?', 'do you know his name?clinton: medvedev -- whatever.russert: yes.clinton: yes.russert: senator obama, do you know anything about him?obama: well, i think senator clinton speaks accurately about him.', 'he is somebody who was hand-picked by putin.', 'putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in russia in terms of running the government.', 'and, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of president bushs administration when he said -- you know, he met with putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him.he then proceeded to neglect our relationship with russia at a time when putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his european neighbors, as well as satellites of the former soviet union.', 'and so we did not send a signal to mr. putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us.', 'that is something that we have to change.russert: hes 42 years old, hes a former law professor.', 'he is mr. putins campaign manager.', 'he is going to be the new president of russia.', 'and if he says to the russian troops, you know what, why dont you go help serbia retake kosovo, what does president obama do?obama: well, i think that we work with the international community that has also recognized kosovo, and state that thats unacceptable.', 'but, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in nato to deal with this issue.we dont have to work in isolation.', 'and this is an area where i think that the clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned.obama: it has not been perfect, but it saved lives.', 'and we created a situation in which not only kosovo, but other parts of the former yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader european community.but, you know, be very clear: we have recognized the country of kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has great britain and many other countries in the region.', 'and i think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded.russert: before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service.', 'looking back through them, is there any words or vote that youd like to take back?senator clinton?clinton: well, obviously, ive said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding iraq was a sincere vote, i would not have voted that way again.i would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in iraq.', 'and i regret deeply that president bush waged a preemptive war, which i warned against and said i disagreed with.but i think that this election has to be about the future.', 'it has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what were going to inherit.you know, weve just been talking about russia.', 'we could have gone around the world.', 'we could have gone to latin america and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy.', 'we could have talked about africa and the failure to end the genocide in darfur.we could have gone on to talk about the challenge that china faces and the middle east, which is deteriorating under the pressures of hamas, hezbollah, and the interference that is putting israels security at stake.we could have done an entire program, tim, on what we will inherit from george bush.and what i believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of pennsylvania avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we dont have much time to try to make up for our losses.russert: but to be clear, youd like to have your vote back?clinton: absolutely.', 'ive said that many times.russert: senator obama, any statements or vote youd like to take back?obama: well, you know, when i first arrived in the senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding terri schiavo.', 'and i remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families.it wasnt something i was comfortable with, but it was not something that i stood on the floor and stopped.', 'and i think that was a mistake, and i think the american people understood that that was a mistake.', 'and as a constitutional law professor, i knew better.and so thats an example i think of where inaction...russert: this is the young woman with the feeding tube...obama: thats exactly right.russert: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not.obama: and i think thats an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action.but let me say this, since were wrapping up this debate.', 'we have gone through 20 debates now.', 'and, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and weve got four coming up, and maybe more after that.but the one thing im absolutely clear about is senator clinton has campaigned magnificently.', 'she is an outstanding public servant.', 'and im very proud to have been campaigning with her.and part of what i think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the american people.you know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics.', 'but when you spend as much time as senator clinton and i have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that peoples expectations are so modest.you know, theyre not looking for government to solve all of their problems.', 'they just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if theyre about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the american dream.you know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about.and, you know, i have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government.', 'thats why i think were both running, and im very pleased that ive had this opportunity to run with senator clinton.russert: but the voters can only choose one, brian.russert: and i think you have a question.williams: well, we dont have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but i am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both.', 'and ill ask it of you fist, senator obama.what is the fundamental question you believe senator clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in ohio and in texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee?', 'and then we will ask the same question of senator clinton.obama: i have to say, brian, i think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee.', 'now, i think id be better.', 'otherwise, i wouldnt be running.', 'but theres no doubt that senator clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than john mccain, who i respect and i honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of george bush over the last seven years.on economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we cant afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we cant afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe.', 'we cant afford it in terms of strategy.so i dont think that senator clinton has to answer a question as to whether shes capable of being president or our standard bearer.i will say this, that the reason i think im better as the nominee is that i can bring this country together i think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region.', 'and that is whats going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both senator clinton and i care so much about.and i also think i have a track record, starting from the days i moved to chicago as a community organizer, when i was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a united states senator, i think i bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the american people can have confidence that their voice is being heard.those are things -- those are qualities that i bring to this race, and i hope that the people of ohio, texas, rhode island and vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the united states.williams: senator clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question senator obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness?clinton: well, brian, there isnt any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the white house.as i said last week, you know, its been an honor to campaign.', 'i still intend to do everything i can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making.you know, obviously i am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which i think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous...(applause)... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are.so i feel that either one of us will make history.the question that i have been posing is, who can actually change the country?', 'and i do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see.you know, when i wasnt successful about getting universal health care, i didnt give up.', 'i just got to work and helped to create the childrens health insurance program.', 'and, you know, today in ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance.', 'and yet this morning in lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident.', 'and she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, will you help us?thats what my public life has been about.', 'i want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have.', 'and i will do whatever i can here in ohio, in texas, rhode island, in the states to come making that case.', 'because i think we do need a fighter back in the white house.you know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president.', 'its time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can.', 'and they deserve somebody who gets up in that white house and goes to bat for them.and thats

different views when it comes to the 10 to 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the united states.this is what you said to say back in april during a town hall at georgetown university:(begin video clip)ryan: im a person who believes that, for the undocumented, we have to come up with a solution that doesnt involve mass deportation, that involves giving people the ability to get right with the law to come and earn a legal status while we fix the rest of legal immigration.', '(end video clip)tapper: now take a listen to what president-elect trump said on morning joe last year.', '(begin video clip, morning joe)trump: were going to have a deportation force.', 'and youre going to do it humanelyquestion: how are you going to pay for this?trump: its very inexpensive.question: are they going to be ripped out of their homes?', 'how?trump: can i tell you, theyre going back where they came.', 'if they came from a certain country, theyre going to be brought back to that country.', 'thats the way its supposed to be.', '(end video clip)tapper: so, congress writes the laws and controls the purse stringsis there going to be mass deportation or not?', 'and this isnt just a nitty-gritty detail.', 'there are millions of people who are very worried about this.ryan: sure.', 'sure.and i think we should put peoples minds at ease.', 'that is not what our focus is.', 'that is not what were focused on.', 'were focused on securing the border.we think thats first and foremost.', 'before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know whos coming and going in the country.', 'we have got to secure the border.', 'so, we believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill, is really the first priority.', 'and thats what were focused on.tapper: ok, so its not a top priority, mass deportation.', 'but, obviously, president-elect trump thinks it is.ryan: no, securing the border is our...tapper: right.ryan: securing the border is our top priority.tapper: right, but about what in year two, year three, year four?ryan: thats why im saying were not focused on -- we are not planning on erecting a deportation force.', 'donald trumps not planning on that.', '[09:10:03]tapper: well, let me ask you, and does the fact that hillary clinton won the popular vote, does that impact in any way your sense of mandate or how far you should be willing to go, considering that the woman who lost actually got more votes?ryan: id say two things.look at the expectations going into this.', 'look at what all the public polling said.', 'look at what all the prognosticators were saying like the day of the election.', 'he beat all the odds.look, what i think people need to stop doing is stop underestimating donald trump.', 'a lot of us did that.', 'i think hes very much of the mind-set that there is a need to unify this country, to heal the division in this country, but also theres a mandate and a desire and a commitment to fix the problems as we have laid the solutions out.so, we all laid out very concrete solutions for why we need to get this country back on track.', 'were now going to implement the solutions.', 'and we think this is good.', 'we think this is going to help people get out of poverty.', 'we think this is going to grow the economy, make our country more secure, make our border secure, help the military go on offense against isis, clean up the red tape that is strangling small businesses, so they can hire people again.these are good things that we have in store that were really excited about getting to work on doing for the american people.tapper: one of the things that you dont mention -- and i can certainly understand why -- when you talk about the path forward with president-elect trump is one of the biggest differences between yourself and donald trump policy-wise, having to do with the issue of trade.in his contract with the american voter, he promised in his 100 days to establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers.', 'will you pass those tariffs in your first 100 days?ryan: well, i think theres a better way of dealing with that particular issue.and if you go to number six on our better way agenda and you look at the tax reform, this is something that donald also talked about during the campaign, which is to fix our taxes on border adjustments, which we believe is a smarter way, which is what all the other countries, which is not tariffs, not trade wars.so, we think there are better ways of dealing with making american products and workers more competitive, and really its fixing our tax code.tapper: throughout the campaign, as you know, president-elect trump talked about tariffs.', 'it could be as high as 35 percent, 45 percent.ryan: yes.tapper: if he comes to you and says, this is what were doing, what are you going say?ryan: the point im trying to make is, i think we can achieve what hes trying -- hes trying to make america more competitive.', 'hes trying to make the american worker more competitive.', 'hes trying to make it so that american businesses stay in america.and we believe the smartest and best way to do that is comprehensive tax reform, which actually makes america much more competitive without any adverse effects, without any collateral damage to the economy.tapper: a minute ago, you were talking about how donald trump, the president-elect, expressed concerned to you he wanted to -- or expressed a desire to you that he wanted to unify the country.', 'on that note, i want to turn to staffing at the trump white house.', 'alot of people, including many conservatives, are concerned that steve bannon, who is the ceo of the trump campaign and the chief executive of breitbart news, that he used breitbart news to, in their view, the view of conservatives, the view of republicans, to mainstream white supremacist views, anti-semitic views, racist views.do you have any concerns about steve bannon being in the white house?ryan: no, i dont have concerns.', 'i have never met the guy.', 'i dont know steve bannon, so i have no concerns.i believe -- i trust donalds judgment.', 'i think hes going to pick who he thinks will best serve him.', 'and im sure we will work well with whoever his chief of staff is, whoever his staff is.so, i believe that donald is going to have a great set of choices to make for staffing.', 'im also very own encouraged by the fact that my friend, a great conservative from -- a man whose shown hes a true leader, mike pence, is going to be running the transition team.so, i think between pence running the transition team -- look, donald is a multibillionaire who has had lots of companies, who has run extremely successful businesses.', 'so, hes done things like this before.', 'hes staffed up.', 'hes run major organizations.', 'hes a successful person.', 'he surrounds himself with successful people.so, im confident hes going to do the same here.tapper: you sound very optimistic and positive about him, but during the campaign, you said that one of the things he said about judge curiel fit the textbook definition of racism.ryan: look, im not going to relitigate the past.', 'im looking for the future.and i want i mean when i say unifying, getting people back to work, fixing welfare so people -- fixing welfare so people can go from welfare to work, replacing this horrible health care law that is really hurting families, putting health care providers out of business, and replacing it with patient-centered health care, rebuilding our national security so were safe again, cleaning up the regulatory state, following the constitution.i mean, these are all good things for our country that we are now working on putting in place the plan to do just that.', 'thats transformational.', 'thats positive.', 'thats good.', '[09:15:01]tapper: the pride of janesville, house speaker paul ryan, thank you so much for joining us.', 'we appreciate it.ryan: all right, thank you jake.', 'take care.', '(end videotape) tapper: the trump transition team has been huddled inside trump tower all weekend as they work to create an administration, cabinet nominees, white house staff.kellyanne conway telling reports yesterday that trumps choice for chief of staff is imminent.', 'that and other picks could tell us a lot about how president-elect trump plans to govern.lets talk about the new trump administration with top adviser rudy giuliani, who is himself rumored to be a contender for several top jobs.mr.', 'mayor, thanks for joining us.', 'and congratulations.rudy giuliani (r), former mayor of new york: thank you, jake.tapper: so, i know youre not going to answer...giuliani: thank you very, very much, jake.tapper: i know youre not going to answer any questions i have about what jobs youre being considered for.', '(laughter)tapper: so, let me just set that aside.theres a big issue...giuliani: thank you.', '(laughter)tapper: theres a big issue at play here as you prepare for the trump administration.i know youre more than cognizant of the fact that donald trump has hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in businesses and business interests around the nation and throughout the world.', 'during the campaign, he was asked what he would do with his businesses if he won.take a listen.', '(begin video clip)trump: if i become president, i couldnt care less about my company.', 'its peanuts.', 'i have ivanka and eric and don sitting there.run the company, kids.', 'have a good time.', 'im going to do it for america, ok?', '(cheering and applause)trump: so, i would be willing to...question: so, you will put your assets in a blind trust?trump: i would put it in a blind trust.well, i dont know if its a blind trust if ivanka, don, and eric run it, but -- is that a blind trust?', 'i dont know.', '(end video clip)tapper: i will answer that question.', 'thats not a blind trust.', 'if your kids run your businesses, its not a blind trust.in a blind trust, there is an independent trustee who takes over your portfolio and directs it without your input or any input from anyone around you.do you think that to avoid any conflicts of interest, not to many questions by the public as to whether hes making decisions at least in part for his own financial reasons, do you think it would be best for mr. trump to set up a true blind trust with no involvement from him or his kids?giuliani: well, first of all, you realize that those laws dont apply to the president, right?', 'so, the president doesnt have to have a blind trust.', 'for some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.i think hes in a very unusual situation.', 'he would basically put his children out of work if -- and theyd have to go start a whole new business, and that would set up the whole -- set up new problems.so, it would seem to me that if he set up a situation in which the children were running it, there was a legal or clear document that meant that he would not be involved, he would have no interest in it, he would have no input into it, he would just have a passive interest, that would be the kind of thing that would work here.its kind of unrealistic to say, youre going to take the business away from the three people who are running it, and give it to some independent person.', 'and, remember, they cant work in the government because of the government rule against nepotism.so, you would be putting them out of work.', 'so, i think youre going to have to fashion something that is very comfortable, something thats fair, something that assures the american people, as he said, he has no interest in whats going on in the business, and that his children get to run the business they know how to run.tapper: right.giuliani: and stay out of all government matters.tapper: well, but, mr. mayor, i mean, his children are -- as i dont need to tell you, they are a huge part of his advisory committee.', 'they are advising the transition, ivanka, don jr., and eric.jared kushner, ivankas husband, is being talked about as coming on board and working at the white house, even if hes not paid for it.if he does not set up a truly blind trust, how can the american people have confidence that, when he makes a decision, that he isnt at least partly making it to enrich himself?giuliani: well, even if he turned it over to an independent trustee and it was the trump corporation, you cant -- i mean, theres no perfect way to do this.you have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president.', 'the man is an enormously wealthy man.', 'i dont think theres any real fear of suspicion that hes seeking to enrich himself by being president.', 'if he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldnt have run for president.so, i think there can be a way to do this.', 'and, by the way, jared kushner has his own company, completely independent of trump, that is a very, very successful real estate company.', 'hes maybe, you know, one of the biggest in new york.', 'he -- so, jared is a kind of different, different situation.tapper: well, i will just say this.', 'and then you can dismiss it as you want.', 'but im putting a flag in it right now.if a blind trust is not set up, this is going to be donald trump for the duration of his presidency, because every decision he makes, whether its the pipeline in north dakota, or business relationships in turkey, everything is going to be under the lens of, well, what is the effect of this on his wealth and his familys wealth?', '[09:20:07]i get that you think that thats not a consideration or not as serious a consideration as...giuliani: no, no, no.what im telling you is, the blind trust solution isnt much better, meaning an independent trustee would run it.', 'and any decision that he made, even if he didnt know it, that helped him, somebody would run it down and say, oh, my goodness, he may have made it for that reason.so, blind trusts arent perfect either.', 'this is a very special kind of situation.tapper: i think its far better than -- its far better than people in his family advising him and then also working on his business.', 'i think...giuliani: but theyre not -- once he gets into government, they will not be -- they will not be -- they will not be advising him.there will be -- there will have to be a wall -- there will have to be a wall between them with regard to government matters and something im very familiar with from my days in the justice department, which is recusing yourself from decisions that involve you or any financial matter involving you.tapper: all right.well, if you thought the issues between the clinton foundation and hillary clintons state department were big, fasten your seat belts.', 'but lets move on.mr.', 'trump shook up the republican primary by...giuliani: oh, i think, i think, jake, jake, jake, i think thats a very unfair suggestion.there, you were talking about enormous amounts of cash.', 'im counting up to about $230 million that went for specific actions like talking to the irs.', 'and i dont -- i dont see that happening in a trump administration.this man didnt run for president because he wants to get rich.', 'hes rich already.tapper: all right.giuliani: so, i dont think youre going to have that happen unless you try to make it happen.tapper: all right.mr.', 'trump shook up the republican primary back in december when he made this promise.', 'take a listen.', '(begin video clip)trump: donald j. trump is calling all and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our countrys representatives can figure out what the hell is doing on.', '(cheering and applause)(end video clip)tapper: so, just a simple question.', 'is that policy still operative?giuliani: well, you know, twice, you used things that he changed during the campaign.', 'he did say that.', 'that is correct.actually, within a day or two of his saying that, he called me and asked me to put a little group together that included congressman mccaul, general flynn -- i cant remember who else, a few other people.', 'we wrote a paper for him.', 'and he amended it to the ban would be restricted to particular countries, and it would not be a ban.it would involve extreme vetting.', 'the one -- the one place in which he would not let anyone in, unless it was an extraordinary circumstance, would be syrian refugees.', 'all the rest from countries that contain dangerous populations of radical islamic extremists, he will subject them to extreme vetting, but not a ban.', 'so, he said that about 100 times during the campaign from the timethat he made that -- from the time that he made that statement.tapper: yes, he said that was an expansion.giuliani: so, you can go back.tapper: he said it was an expansion of his original proposal.but lets talk about what youre talking about, specifically, mr. trump wanting to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur and also extreme vetting.back in june, when senator jeff sessions, a strong supporter and adviser of president-elect trump, when senator sessions was on the program, he identified six countries that might fall into that category, pakistan, egypt, syria, iraq, afghanistan, and yemen.so, now that mr. trump has been elected president, can you tell us if those are the six countries that will see a suspension of immigration?giuliani: well, i would say that those countries are certainly countries where we would have to be very careful.now, lets take egypt, for example.', 'egypt, we could probably do some pretty good vetting.', 'the sisi government is a strong ally.', 'it has a pretty good hold on the muslim brotherhood.', 'im not saying perfect, but they have done a lot of work in reducing the power of the muslim brotherhood.', 'they have a very, very mature and really strong army.', 'you could do vetting in egypt.yemen, a lot more volatile, a lot more difficult to do vetting.', 'so, i think this is going to be a country-by-country decision.', 'pakistan, you can do pretty good vetting.', 'so, a lot of this is going to depend on, you know, how cooperative is the country were talking about?', 'how many records can we get?the reason the syrian problem was so bad, the syrian refugees, its not just that you cant vet them, which actually director comey and i think about five members of the obama administration have made clear, that you cant vet these people, these refugees from syria.', '[09:25:12]the problem also is that baghdadi has said he is going to put terrorist operatives in with the refugee population.', 'hes told us hes going to do this.tapper: right.giuliani: so, we would be foolish -- we would be foolish to allow these people to come into the united states.were sort of being warned that hes bringing more people into attack us.', 'we already have 1,000 investigations of radical islamic terrorists in the united states.', 'we cant add another whole group to that.tapper: i want to ask you.', 'russias deputy foreign minister, sergei ryabkov, was quoted as saying that the russian government maintained contacts with members of trumps -- quote -- immediate entourage during the presidential campaign.what can you tell us about those contacts?giuliani: i know of no such contacts with the russian government.i was pretty deeply involved in the campaign.', 'i was with donald trump, you know, day and night for about 100 days actually at one period.', 'so, if thats going on, its going on somewhere where i didnt see it.it is true that i think donald trump wants to engage russia in areas where we can work together in a way that hillary clinton and john kerry and barack obama failed to do.', 'but, remember, hes going to do it from a different point of view.youre forgetting his campaign promise of increasing dramatically the size of the military and doing away with the sequester.', 'were going to go up to 550,000 troops, where were going down to 420,000.tapper: well, let me ask you a quick question about troops.giuliani: were going to go up to 350 ships.tapper: putin...giuliani: were going to go up to 350 troops (sic).', 'let me finish.tapper: yes.giuliani: were going to go up to 1,200 modern aircraft.', 'and were going to increase the size of the marines from about 27 battalions to 36.so, hes going to be facing, putin, with a country that is not diminishing its military, but a country that is dramatically increasing it to reagan-like levels, so that he can negotiate -- and he talked about this a lot during the campaign -- hes going to negotiate for peace, but with strength, not with a diminishing army.tapper: a spokesman for putin said that one of the first things that trump can do as president is to convince nato to pull back troops from near the russian border.do you have any idea if any decision has been made along those lines?giuliani: no.', 'no decision like that has been made, thought about.in fact, during the campaign, donald trump talked about forward positioning of some troops in nato as kind of a bargaining chip with some of the nato countries that are not putting in their fair share, their 2 percent.', 'tapper: ok.giuliani: and i think youre going see something more like that.i think a president trump would want to increase the impact of nato, but make sure that these countries are participating.', 'you know, when we were fighting in iraq and we had some of these countries participating, their armies werent fighting.', 'they were watching us, the u.k., and canada fight, and they were just observing.well, it cant work that way.tapper: all right.giuliani: they have got to be full participants.', 'and we have to be full participants.tapper: mr. mayor, thank you so much.', 'and congratulations again.giuliani: thank you.tapper: donald trump used the power of social media to help propel him into the white house.', 'he instantly was able to fight back against critics, reporters, even members of his own party if they challenged him, which begged the question, what will president trump twitter feed look like?we now have his answer.', '(begin video clip)trump: im going to do very restrained, if i use it at all.', 'im going to be very restrained.i find it tremendous.', 'it is a modern form of communication.', 'there should be nothing you should be ashamed of.', 'its -- its where its at.i do believe this.', 'i really believe that the fact that i have such power in terms of numbers with facebook, twitter, instagram, et cetera, i think it helped me win all of these races where theyre spending much more money than i spent.', 'and i won.', '(end video clip)tapper: president obama is going to have to hand over the @potus twitter handle to president-elect trump.what should we expect from @potus when he enters the oval office?joining me now is our panel, republican national committee chief strategist and communications director sean spicer, cnn politics reporter sara murray, cnn senior political reporter nia-malika henderson, and house democratic caucus leader congressman xavier becerra of california.sean, let me start with you.in the final stretch of the campaign, it was reported that some of president-elect trumps top aides had to wrest his phone away from him, so as to not have one of these sudden outbursts in the middle of the night or whatever.', '[09:30:10]what do you see going forward for the potus account?sean spicer, rnc chief strategist, communications director: well, i think theres always a transition from campaigning to governing.', 'youve seen it both with his speech wednesday morning when he accepted that victory that he won for the american people.', 'and then his comments when he was in washington, d.c. with the president and others.he understands that.', 'he understands the role of the president in the words that he uses and the tweets that he sends will impact the country in a much different way than they do during a campaign.tapper: good enough for you, congressman?rep.', 'xavier becerra (d), california: no, because weve heard all sorts of words from donald trump.as a candidate you can say all you want, as a president, one word you say can affect not just markets, but the american people.', 'so interest rates have already spiked.', 'they are not sure whats going to happen in the markets since -- so today we try to buy a house as an american, it costs you more for the mortgage than it did two weeks ago.', 'and so it will make a difference what he says.', 'more importantly what he does.tapper: sara, you covered trump for the last year and a half.', 'he has since winning, there has been one kind of stray tweet in which he got mad at protesters and then i dont know what happened behind the scenes, but then he corrected it and celebrated their right to protest.how do you see this holding, this quote/unquote presidential trump?sara murray, cnn political reporter: well, hes already tweeting this morning attacks at the new york times.so i think the notion that all the sudden donald trump has woken up and realized that his weight carry or his words carry a lot more weight doesnt always stand.', 'i think there are aides around him who remind him that you need to recalibrate your tone.', 'i think thats what we saw from the two different tweets about protesters.', 'one going after them and then one saying i love to see passionate people expressing their belief.', 'that to me was a good indication that someone talked to him and said words matter more now, but the fact is, he still does have control of his twitter.', 'and there doesnt seem to be anyone whos sitting with him this morning.', 'so i still think it is an open question of how he behaves and if he does realize that there are millions and millions of people following him there.', 'and there already even more once he takes over the potus twitter handle.tapper: this is a silly question on its face but i actually mean it very seriously.', 'do you think that -- i mean, obviously there were tweets sent out under his name by him and there are ones sent out by his campaign, you can actually tell ones were which by which device it was sent by.nia-malika henderson, cnn senior political reporter: yes.tapper: do you think it is up to kellyanne conway or whomever in his inner circle to change his password so he no longer has access to his twitter feed?henderson: you would hope something like that happens.', 'i dont even know the way in which he tweets if hes just firing them off, dictating them to somebody else who fires them off but this is going to be a problem.primarily because donald trump has made the best argument for why he should keep tweeting in the same way, and that is, oh, he won.', 'and it didnt harm him throughout the primaries.', 'it didnt harm him in the general election.', 'he actually believes its helped him.and i also think, if you look at the people who support donald trump, they like that bombast.', 'they like that rhetoric.', 'that -- they like the fact that he isnt some sort of p.c.', 'blow-dried politician.', 'so in that way, i think its going to be hard to rest some of the -- not only the twitter account from him, but the way he engages with the public, the way he engages with the media, the way he engages with his own party and the folk that he is doesnt like, whether its ted cruz or ted cruz or ted cruzs wife or whoever.', 'i think this is going to be an issue and im not so sure that its going to be -- we see another donald trump once he assumes the office.tapper: sara, we were talking before the show about how the trump people are constantly trying to act as though he didnt propose banning all muslims from entering the united states until a total complete shutdown until we figure out just what the hell is going on.you heard mayor giuliani say that he basically walked that back although as you know he expanded it -- he described it as an expansion.', 'take a listen to what mr. trump -- president-elect trump had to say about the issue just a few days ago.', '(begin video clip)unidentified female reporter: are you going to ask congress to ban muslims from entering the country?trump: thank you, everybody.', 'thank you.', '(end video clip) tapper: so where is this policy?murray: thats a great question.', 'i think this is going to be a question for a lot of donald trumps policies.', 'because we put a lot out there on the campaign trail.', 'that he didnt necessarily flush out entirely and that he sort of walked back at points and then doubled down at points.', 'thats what we saw with the muslim ban.the last thing we heard from donald trump was that when he talked about extreme vetting which at times included a religious test that to him was an expansion of the muslim ban.', 'but i think we saw the same thing when you talked to paul ryan about the notion of a deportation force and donald trump on a deportation force.', 'maybe theyre not calling it a deportation force anymore.', 'maybe thats not what donald trumps calling it.', 'maybe thats not what house speaker paul ryan is calling it.but he has called for 5,000 additional border control agents.', 'he has called for tripling the number of ice officers.', 'so there is certainly some sort of bolstering of these forces that would allow for increased deportation which is something donald trump promised.', '[09:35:01]but i think everyone is kind of waiting to see how these things donald trump talks about on the campaign trail will turn into actual policy when hes in the white house and when hes dealing with capitol hill.tapper: there does seem to be, sean, a certain degree of people who are within the trump orbit acting as though he didnt make certain proposals during the campaign that are on videotape or on the donald j. trump website.', 'i mean, why is it an unreasonable question to ask if the muslim ban is actually going to happen or a deportation --(crosstalk)spicer: its not unreasonable question.but i think that theres going to be a time between now and january 20th where he will assemble a team and his priorities of how hes going to get things done.', 'hes got to work with congress.', 'and i think those conversations that started the other day have to continue in terms of this isnt a dictatorship.', 'this is democracy.', 'we have to work with the house and the senate.', 'he will continue his discussions with speaker ryan and leader mcconnell to layout the priorities of the sequencing but then also the exact -- the details of those policies.tapper: congressman becerra, we talked -- i talked to you on the beginning of the show with speaker ryan about the fears that many americans feel.you represent a district with a large latino population in california.', 'what are people feeling in your district?becerra: ive heard everything from kids afraid to go to school because theyre not sure their parents will be home when they get there.', 'ive heard some families talk about not going to work.', 'ive heard some people afraid to walk the streets because they may look like theyre muslim.', 'ive heard everything and there is a great deal of apprehension.be a great time right now.', 'this is a prime time now for donald trump.', 'it would be great time for him to get out there and say some words that would calm people to make sure that everyone feels comfortable going out.', 'whether its to demonstrate civilly or whether its just to go to school, but this is prime time now.', 'and donald trumps words will make a big difference because so much of his talk during the campaign was so harsh and for many people, frightening.tapper: and nia-malika, take a look at this.', 'this is from york, pennsylvania, where students were caught on camera holding a trump sign while another student shouted, white power.', '(begin video clip)unidentified male: white power.', 'white power.', 'white power.', '(end video clip)tapper: so thats a -- i dont know if thats a vine.', 'its a loop of some sort.', 'but in any case, theres an investigation going on there, minority students have said they experienced more harassment since this election started.now as i mentioned at the top of the show, there has also been violence against trump supporters.', 'but in the schools of america anecdotally it seems to be a lot of this.', 'do you think that president-elect trump and in addition, perhaps even president obama and hillary clinton have an obligation to come out and try to calm things?henderson: i think they do.you heard some of that from donald trump in his wednesday morning address when he talked about binding americas wounds.', 'and youve heard that from also paul ryan talking about the republican party being the party of lincoln and being and inclusive party.i do think its incumbent on donald trump to shift his rhetoric, to continue the rhetoric about unity.', 'i do think he probably has a steeper heel to climb.', 'because i think just plainly, there are a lot of americans who think that donald trump is a bigot and they dont think hes a bigot because they have any sort of prejudged notions about a republican president, they think that because of some of the things he said during the campaign.so the question is, can he give a sort of bob dole speech, the kind of speech he gave in the 1996 convention where he said, were not a party of racists, talking about republicans.', 'can he give that speech?', 'and will people believe him?', 'i think thats the question.you know, ive heard from friends too.', 'ive got a friend whos a middle school teacher.', 'he said the latino students were lined up at his door on wednesday morning.', 'some of them werent even his students.', 'and they were incredibly afraid about what this president, he would look like, and what it would mean for them and their families.tapper: big challenge for president-elect trump going forward.', 'thank you so much one and all.coming up protests against donald trumps election continue across the country this weekend.', 'on the frontlines at trump tower, michael moore who predicted a trump win.', 'hell be here live, next.', '(commercial break)[09:43:16]tapper: welcome back to state of the union.', 'im jake tapper.in the days since her defeat by donald trump, hillary clinton has been pretty busy.', 'she was spotted walking her dog in the woods of chappaqua.', 'she handed out thousands of red roses to her campaign staff to thank them.', 'and she at least partially

democrats of a trump win on this show, on his blog and elsewhere.thanks so much for joining us, michaelmichael moore, filmmaker: thanks for having me, jake.tapper: so what do you make of hillary clinton telling donors on saturday that fbi director comey is at least largely to blame for her loss?', 'do you agree?', 'is she is in denial, whats your take?moore: i think its part of it, absolutely.', 'and i would -- ive actually called upon president obama to appoint a special prosecutor, as soon as possible, to investigate how it is that the fbi director was able to interfere with an election, which i believe is not legal and help to tip the balance in what was going to be a very close election.', 'i think that not only should people speak about it, it needs to be investigated.tapper: but, lets talk about one of the other weaknesses clearly of her campaign which you were talking about months ago which is the fact that there wasnt really any sort of direct economic outreach or plan to working class white voters in places like michigan where youre from.ed rendell, the former governor of pennsylvania telling the new york times that the clinton campaign failed to spread its best resources outside philadelphia and pittsburgh.', '[09:45:04]he wanted the clinton campaign doing more in the rural white pockets of the state saying quote, we had the resources to do both.', 'the campaign -- and this was coming from her campaign headquarters in brooklyn -- didnt want to do it.do you think that this is also a large part of what happened?moore: yes.', 'i think that also is part of it.i think how many months was it before she hadnt been to wisconsin?', 'i know she hadnt been to michigan.', 'there was a rush trip at the end there to grand rapids.but, you know, i mean, where i come from -- i live in michigan, so were used to both parties.', 'the republican party, which controls the state house and the governor in michigan has contributed to poisoning the people of flint and still hasnt fixed the problem.', 'so were used to the treatment of that party.were also used to the neglect, the benign neglect from democrats or i should say the old school democrats who basically -- once they get in have a hard time dealing with, especially cities that have large minority populations or in the cases of say flint or detroit, these are majority black cities and they largely go ignored (ph).', 'they get a lot of lip service.and the funny thing is that donald trump kind of saw that and made that point, even though he will be the last person to visit detroit or flint to help us.', 'and i think that the people that voted for him in michigan are going to again be up for another rude awakening when they realize hes going to not do a damn thing to make the situation better and probably will make it worse.tapper: obviously a lot of people who supported hillary clinton are trying to deal with this new world order.', 'oprah winfrey, for example, making headlines angering a lot of clinton supporters with comments that she made about trump and obama.take a listen.', '(begin video clip)oprah winfrey, talk show host: i just saw president-elect trump with president obama in the white house, and it gave me hope.unidentified female: ok.winfrey: it gave me hope.', 'i mean, i have to say, just to hear president-elect trump say that he had respect for president obama, it felt that he had reached a moment where he was actually humbled by that experience.', 'i think everybody can take a deep breath.', '(end video clip)

nice.look, thats the side show that has to happen in a week like this.', 'but frankly, you know, democrats would be better off if they ran oprah or tom hanks or -- why dont we run beloved people?', 'we have so many of them.the republicans do this.', 'they run reagan and the terminator and other people.', 'why dont we, why dont we run somebody that the american people love?', 'that they are really drawn to and theyre smart and have good politics and all that.', 'why dont democrats do that?im telling you, jake, my sincere hope is that the dnc that there is a clean sweep in this party.', 'they all have to go, and they have to make room for the progressive democrats who are going to come in here, are going to be needed to fight the things that trump is going to do to the people of this country and the world.', 'and we need young people, and women, and others who are going to really be the voice of this party.not the same old, same old -- clearly people wanted change.', 'i think everybody has admitted that and clearly bernie sanders represented that.', 'and you know, i was -- i was at the demonstration yesterday and there were trump people there on the sidewalk.', 'and i went over and talked to them and i said, you know, would you have considered voting for bernie sanders?', 'and they said yes, they were just mad at the system.tapper: well let me ask you this, so thats the big question, what did democrats do going forward organizationally, do they double down on progressive views the kind espoused by bernie sanders?', 'do they try to reach out to somebody who understands the working class white voters that voted for donald trump in droves?', 'a fight already under way for the dnc chair.', 'several people have put their names forward including howard dean,

in cuba and it will continue to operate, but an embassy, im not, i dont believe this country should be diplomatically recognizing a nation of the nature of cuba.', 'obviously there are other dictatorships in the world that we have relations with by geopolitical reality.', 'you know, chinas the largest country in the world, the second largest economy, the second largest military force.', 'there are geopolitical realities there.', 'cuba is a brutal, tyrannical dictatorship 90 miles from the shore of our country.', 'it is a nation that helps north korea evade u.n. weapon sanctions.', 'it is a country that harbors fugitives from american justice, including medicare fraudsters and someone who killed a police officer in the united states.', 'and i just think that we should have continued with the policy and perhaps looked for new ways of — continue with the policy of not recognizing that regime and not allowing them access to economic growth that would allow them to perpetuate themselves in power, and continue to search for ways to provide the cuban people with more information about the reality of the world so they would be empowered to eventually create for themselves a democratic society.youve also said that you would reverse the presidents deal with iran, assuming that that is finalized.', 'you said you would absolutely do that.', 'what would that look like on day one?well, i would not adhere — well, we have to understand the deal, basically, can be what it is on paper.', 'what the president is banking on is that hes going to use a national security waiver to lift the sanctions on iran, the economic sanctions that now exist.', 'and we would simply re-impose the sanctions.', 'and i still have tremendous questions about whether this deals even viable.', 'the iranians are now saying that what were saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things.', 'this issue of them asking for immediate relief of sanctions the minute the deal is signed is going to be a deal breaker.', 'i hope it would be a deal break for this administration.', 'and at the end of the day, we need to recognize that what iran is trying to do here, and this is clear to anyone who has inside knowledge into this or has followed it closely, iran is trying to maintain all the infrastructure they need to be nuclear capable without agreeing to any irreversible concessions.', 'and that seems to be what they have achieved, if in fact this moves forward.', 'so in my mind, we would just reinstitute the sanctions.but im just thinking this through.', 'the deal is made.', 'its made not just with the united states, but with the european allies.', 'would you move forward with re-imposing sanctions even if the europeans dont go along with it?yes, it wouldnt be as effective, obviously.', 'we would, ultimately, i think, the europeans are going to have a test anyway because the iranians are going to violate the sanctions at some point.', 'theyre going to evade it either by trying to take advantage of loopholes in the deal, or theyll just flat out evade it because theyve always had a secret component to their, to their program.', 'and at that point, theyre going to have a huge test on their hands, which is, are they willing to live by the agreement that they even signed on to?', 'but from the united states perspective, while we want our allies to join us in this endeavor, and certainly sanctions against iran would be more effective were they in conjunction with our allies around the world, we have to look out for our own national security concerns.', 'and in my mind, if the president wanted this to be a permanent deal that survived his presidency, he would have brought it to congress.im just thinking through further, though, as part of this deal, assuming its finalized, the iranians get rid of a vast amount of enriched uranium, almost all they have.', 'they limit the amount of enrichment that they will have.', 'they limit the number of centrifuges they will operate and they will allow inspections for decades, actually.', 'so you would say, all that, forget about it, its done.they would retain all the infrastructure, first of all, they ...they retain infrastructure, sure.they retain not only just infrastructure, they retain centrifuges, too.', 'they may not be spinning them, but they will retain them in their possession.', 'they continue to develop their long range missile capabilities, which are unstopped.', 'theres no prohibition on them acquiring a weapon design as they probably, may even already have.', 'they continue to sponsor terrorism all over the world.', 'in fact, now theyll have more funding to pay for it, in places they already control, places like beirut.', 'theyre increasingly active in yemen.', 'their hand and their roles clear in bahrain and in a growing number of places around the world.', 'and they continue to be run by a radical shia cleric who has apocalyptic views of the future and of their role in it.', 'so none of these things change.', 'their infrastructure will remain in place and at some point, they could follow the north korean model very easily, which is they can cook up an excuse for why they need to have a weapon program and move forward on it.is war inevitable then?i hope not.', 'my hope is that we can delay a program long enough and you would hope that there would be some sort of change in leadership in iran that would at least allow them to decide that they would rather have an economy than have a weapon.', 'you cant guarantee it.', 'but at the end of the day no one wants war, but i actually think that this deal could advance the prospects of war.', 'i think this deal and the fact that iran will retain nuclear infrastructure increases the likelihood that one of their neighbors may take action against them, whether its israel or the saudis or someone else.', 'it also increases the likelihood now, that iran becomes even more aggressive in its proxy wars that its conducting all over the world.', 'it also increases the likelihood that theyll increase their conventional capabilities threatening our u.s. presence in the region.', 'and ultimately i think it almost guarantees an arms race in the region, because the saudis have made very clear, and others, the egyptians as well, that whatever iran has, theyll get as well.', 'so if iran is allowed to enrich to a certain level, they will begin doing the same, requiring a capability to do the same.let me ask about a domestic issue.', 'in recent weeks, the state of indiana passed a religious freedom law, which was interpreted by many as discrimination, by others, as protection for people who dont want to take part in gay marriage.', 'you defended the law and spoke about the hypothetical example of a florist who was asked to participate in a gay marriage and wanted to refuse.', 'you said that person should have the right to follow their religious beliefs.', 'indiana, though, has since changed the law.', 'do you still support that concept?well, to be fair, i havent read the change in detail to give you an opinion on it specifically, but ill tell you where i stand.', 'i dont believe you can discriminate against people.', 'so i dont believe its right for a florist to say, im not going to provide you flowers because youre gay.', 'i think theres a difference between not providing services to a person because of their identity, who they are or who they love, and saying, im not going to participate in an event, a same-sex wedding, because that violates my religious beliefs.', 'theres a distinction between those two things.', 'so, certainly, you cant not — its immoral and wrong to say, im not going to allow someone whos gay or lesbian to use my restaurant, stay in my hotel, or provide photography service to them because theyre gay.', 'the difference here is, were not talking about discriminating against a person because of who they are, were talking about someone whos saying — what im talking about, anyway, is someone whos saying, i just dont want to participate as a vendor for an event, a specific event that violates the tenets of my faith.what if two gay people get married and then they go that night to a hotel.', 'can the hotelkeeper refuse service to them?thats not part of an event.', 'again, i mean, thats, theres a difference between saying, were not going to allow you to stay in our hotel, common lodging establishment where people have a right to shelter, food, medical care, and saying were not going to, what were not going to do is provide services to an event, to an actual event, which is the wedding itself.', 'and i think thats the distinction point that people have been pointing to, and, because mainstream christianity teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman.', 'people feel very strongly about that.', 'and to ask someone to individually provide services to something of that nature, i think violates their religious liberty.theres a big question lurking here, which is that most americans, according to surveys, now support gay marriage.', 'a large minority of americans still oppose gay marriage.', 'the question is, that people seem to be wrestling with, is, what ground do opponents of gay marriage have left to stand on?', 'what ground should they have to stand on?first of all, if the majority of americans support gay marriage, then youll see it reflected in changes in state law, which has always regulated marriage.', 'and so at the end of the day, if a majority of people in any given state in this country petition their legislature to change the definition of marriage to include the marriage of two people of the same sex, thatll be the law of the land.', 'and that is what it is.', 'separate from that, theres a constitutional protection of religious liberty that allows people to live by the tenets of their faith both in their public and in private life.', 'that doesnt mean that youre allowed to go in and disrupt a gay wedding.', 'but by the same token, it doesnt mean that someones allowed to come to you and force you to be a participant in a ceremony that violates the tenets of your faith.', 'and to be honest, in the real world, 99.9% of the time, a same-sex couple doesnt want a florist or a photographer at their wedding that doesnt agree with the choice that theyve made.', 'so were really talking about an issue that in large part is really not going to manifest itself in daily life, but in the instances that it does, there are individuals that dont want to be compelled by force of law to participate in an event that puts them in the position of violating their religious faith.', 'theres a difference between that and discriminating against an individual because of who they are.are there are other specific situations on your mind where you feel that people who are opposed to gay marriage would need some kind of protection from, from it?well, i mean, thats the one thats in the news today.', 'again, i dont, we can always sit here and engage in hypotheticals, this, that, and the other, but at the end of the day, i mean, thats the one thats emerged because theres real cases behind people being fined for not providing services to a, to a ceremony as opposed to individuals.when we spoke last year, we talked about immigration, an issue on which you worked for a time on an immigration reform bill.', 'you said, first, the reason to do that is not political, its substantive.', 'but, second, that there would be a political effect.', 'that if the republican party deals with immigration, it would then have an opportunity to talk with latino voters about other issues.', 'and, of course, this is a voter group where republicans have done very poorly in recent elections.', 'immigration hasnt been dealt with.', 'what are the likely consequences for the republican party in 2016?well, again, every candidate has a different position on where they stand on the issue.', 'from my perspective, i continue to believe its an issue we need to address.', 'the only point ive made is that i think the lessons of the last couple of years, for me, is that were not going to be able to deal with it in one big piece of legislation.', 'i still think we need to do immigration reform.', 'i just dont think you can do it in a comprehensive, massive piece of legislation, given the lack of trust that there is today in the federal government.', 'i honestly believe that the key to moving forward on immigration is to first and foremost prove to the american people that we are going to bring future illegal immigration under control — that if we legalize 12 million people, they wont be replaced by 12 million more who are here illegally.', 'and i honestly believe, given my experiences on this issue now, that if we did that, the american people and the majority of republicans and conservatives will be very reasonable and, and responsible about how we address the reality that we have 12 million human beings living in this country illegally.but were in a circumstance, granted theres still time, but were in a circumstance where it doesnt look like immigration legislation is going to get through congress before 2016. what does that mean for your party?and i think, i think its nearly – well, i just outlined to you what i think the key is to moving forward.', 'and i think thats impossible as long as barack obamas president now, because on two instances, particularly very recently, last year, he issued an executive order ordering federal agencies not to enforce immigration law.', 'so if im telling you that the key to moving forward is the enforcement of immigration law, then that says the notion that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, and you have a president thats ordering agencies not to enforce immigration law, our ability to convince people, no matter what we pass, that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, as long as barack obamas president, is nil.how do you keep from getting hammered on that in a general election where the hispanic vote may be very important?well, i dont know about the others, but ive done more immigration than hillary clinton ever did.', 'i mean, i helped pass an immigration bill in a senate dominated by democrats.', 'and thats more than shes ever done.', 'shes given speeches on it, but shes never done anything on it.', 'so i have a record of trying to do something on it.', 'it didnt work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration and i warned about that throughout that process, as well, that i didnt think we were doing enough to give that bill a chance of moving forward in the house.does your biography help?i think biographys part of all of our lives, all of our candidacies, because it certainly influences how you view the country and how you view issues.', 'i have a personal attachment to the working class because its where i come from, its still the neighborhood i live in, its the people my children go to school with, its the community that im involved in.', 'and, but i also happen to think its the identity of our country.', 'and every candidate, you know, will bring to bear their experiences in life and how its guided them and influenced their thinking, but from my perspective, i think it matters simply because it informs me on my policy decisions.theres a big question here, also, because the republican party, as many people have noted, faces a demographic challenge that gets a little worse with every election cycle.', 'growing groups in society, such as latinos and others, are voting increasingly democratic, and republican voter groups, particularly older white voters, are getting smaller.', 'whats the republican party need to do about that?well, at the end, i dont think people go to the ballot box and say, im a latino, therefore im voting democrat.', 'i think they bring with them their hopes and fears about the future, and they vote for whoever they think best understands them.', 'and the challenge the republican party has had is unfairly, but its the reality, theyve been portrayed as a party that doesnt care about people who are trying to make it.', 'a disproportionate number of people who are trying to make it, who are working class, who are out there working for a living at $18 an hour, $15 an hour, happen to also be people from minority communities.', 'and if you think someone doesnt care or understand people like you, no matter what your policies are, its going to be difficult to get them to listen to you, much less vote for you.', 'and so i hope the republican party can become the champion of the working class because i think our policy proposals of limited government and free enterprise are better for the people who are trying to make it than big government is.', 'the fact is that big government helps the people who have made it.', 'if you can afford to hire an army of lawyers, lobbyists and others to help you navigate and sometimes influence the law, youll benefit.', 'and so thats why you see big banks, big companies, keep winning.', 'and everybody else is stuck and being left behind.so youre beginning this gigantic game of survivor with who knows how many other candidates.', 'youre smiling as i say that.', 'with who knows how many other candidates, what will determine who survives ultimately and how will you make sure its you?well, there are basics about any campaign.', 'obviously youll have to put time into it, youll have to be able to raise sufficient funds to communicate your message.', 'and on a daily basis, you have to make sure you do the best you can to help convince people in a crowded field that youre the best person at this time for the job that you seek.', 'but beyond it, i really think the key is, who can inspire our country into believing that the future doesnt have to be worse than our past, that the 21st century can be better than the 20th.', 'and then once youve inspired them to believe that, showing them how we can accomplish it.', 'and i feel very confident in our ability to do it and i think thats why were going to win.should i think of this as an insurgent campaign, because you dont have the resources of jeb bush, particularly?well, i think our resources will be sufficient to do the job were trying to do.', 'at the end of the day, this is not a fundraising competition in and of itself.', 'you also have to have a message and a

chrome-and-glass grand hyatt hotel.he had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it.', '‘if the seller was italian,’ says mr. trump,

has worked for him.preston robert tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the loews corporation, who lost out to mr. trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘he captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than i could.’the condominiums in trump tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices,

in trump tower.', 'no one else would have done that.', 'if the building fails everyone will say: ‘well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?”‘what sets trump apart,’ says ben v. lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.he gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies.', 'but his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such.', 'this ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’‘you don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with donald.’mr.', 'trump does not place patience on his list of virtues.', 'workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from florida to trump tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost.', 'the 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium.', 'mr. trump did not like the look.', 'he ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, mr. trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw.he speaks slowly and

to do this is by working closely with our partners, strengthening our alliances, not weakening them or walking away from them.second, here at home, we must harden our own defenses.', 'we have to do more to support our first responders, law enforcement and intelligence officers who do incredible work every day at great personal risk to keep our country safe.', '(applause)i have seen firsthand how hard their job is, and how well they do it.in orlando, at least one police officer was shot in the head.', 'thankfully, his life was saved by a kevlar helmet, something folks here at team wendy know a lot about.', '(applause)it has often been said that our law enforcement, our intelligence agencies, our first responders have to be right 100 percent of the time, but terrorists only have to be right once.what a heavy responsibility.', 'these men and women deserve both our respect and gratitude.', 'and they deserve the right tools, and resources and training.', 'too often, state and local

enforcement and business owners on ways to protect vulnerable, so-called soft targets, like nightclubs and shopping malls and hotels and movie theaters and schools and houses of worship.now, i know a lot of americans are asking how it was possible that someone already on the fbis radar could have still been able to commit an attack like the one in orlando, and what more we can do to stop this kind of thing from happening again.well, we have to see what the investigation uncovers.', 'if there are things that can and should be done to improve our ability to prevent, we must do them.', 'we already know we need more resources for this fight.', 'the professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out.thats why i have proposed an intelligence surge to bolster our capabilities across the board with appropriate safeguards here at home.even as we make sure our security officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, its essential that we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attack.', '(applause)clinton: and that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in orlando and san bernardino.', '(applause)i believe weapons of war have no place on our streets and we may have our disagreements about gun safety regulations, but we should all be able to agree on a few essential things.if the fbi is watching you for a suspected terrorist link, you shouldnt be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.and you shouldnt be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show.and yes, if youre too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america.now, i know some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism.', 'well, in orlando and san bernardino terrorists used assault weapons, the ar-15.', 'and they used it to kill americans.', 'that was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in sandy hook.we have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war.', 'and that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack, but it will stop some and it will save lives and it will protect our first responders.and i want you to know, im not going to stop fighting for these kinds of provisions.now, the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by isis and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the united states and europe.for starters, it is long past time for the saudis, the qataris and the kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.', 'and they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism.we also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online.', 'this is something that i spend a lot of time on at the state department.as president, i will work with our great tech companies from silicon valley to boston to step up our game.', 'we have to a better job intercepting isis communications, tracking and analyzing social media posts and mapping jihadist networks, as well as promoting credible voices who can provide alternatives to radicalization.and there is more to do offline as well.clinton: since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have worked hard to build relationships with muslim american communities.', 'millions of peace-loving muslims live, work and raise their families across america.', 'and they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before its too late, and the best positioned to help us block it.', 'so we should be intensifying contacts in those communities, not scapegoating or isolating them.', '(applause)last year, i visited a pilot program in minneapolis that helps parents, teachers, imams, mental health professionals and others recognize signs of radicalization in young people and work with law enforcement to intervene before its too late.ive also met with local leaders pursuing innovative approaches in los angeles and other places.', 'and we need more efforts like that in more cities across america.', 'and as the director of the fbi has pointed out, we should avoid eroding trust in that community, which will only make law enforcements job more difficult.inflammatory anti-muslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of muslim americans as well as millions of muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of muslims who love freedom and hate terror.', '(applause)so does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow americans because of their religion.', 'its no coincidence that hate crimes against american muslims and mosques have tripled after paris and san bernardino.', 'thats wrong.', 'and its also dangerous.', 'it plays right into the terrorists hands.still, as i have said before, none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face enemies who use their distorted version of islam to justify slaughtering $ innocent people.', 'theyd take us all back to the stone age if they could, just as they have in parts of iraq and syria.the terrorist in orlando targeted lgbt americans out of hatred and bigotry.', 'and an attack on any american is an attack on all americans.', '(applause) and i want to say this to all the lgbt people grieving today in florida and across our country.', 'you have millions of allies who will always have your back.', '(applause)and i am one of them.', '(applause)from stonewall to laramie, and now orlando, weve seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence.', 'we have to stand together, be proud together.', 'there is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.our open, diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism, not a liability.', 'it makes us stronger and more resistant to radicalization.', 'and this raises a larger point about the future of our country.america is strongest when we all believe that we have a stake in our country and our future.clinton: this vision has sustained us from the beginning.', 'the belief that, yes, we are all created equal and the journey we have made to turn that into reality over the course of our history, that we are not a land of winners and losers, that we should all have the opportunity to live up to our god-given potential.', 'and we have a responsibility to help others do so as well.', '(applause)as i look at american history, i see that this has

only thing weve endangered is the reputation of the people in power who are building this massive spying apparatus without any accountability who are trying to hide from the american people what it is that they are doing.', 'there is no national security harm from letting people know that they are collecting all phone records, that they are tapping into the internet, that they are planning massive cyber attacks both foreign and -- and even domestic.', 'these are things that the american people have a right to know.', 'the only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and they way they exercise power in the dark.stephanopoulos: one of the things you reported is that the government has, quote, direct access to the servers of massive internet firms, like google and microsoft and facebook, and all the companies have come out and denied it.', 'you see google saying, the u.s. government does not have direct access or a backdoor to the information stored in our data centers.', 'similar statements from facebook and apple.', 'and mr. clapper also said, the u.s. government does not unilaterally obtain information.', 'now, i take it there could be some semantic word games being played here.', 'whats your understanding about what is actually happening?', 'because it does appear that they dont have direct access to the servers.greenwald: well, our story was very clear.', 'what we said was that, and -- and we presented it as the story from the start, was that we have top secret nsa documents that claim that there is a new program called the prism program, in place since 2007 that provides, in the words of the nsas own documents, direct collection, directly from the servers of these companies.', 'we then went to all of those companies named, and they said no, we dont provide direct access to our servers, so there was a conflict, which is what we reported, that the nsa claims that they have direct access, the companies deny it.clearly, there are all kinds of negotiations taking place and all kinds of agreements that have been reached between these internet companies that store massive amounts of communication data about people around the world, and the government.', 'we should have this debate out in the open.', 'let these companies that collect massive amounts of information about people, and the government, resolve this discrepancy in public.', 'tell us what it is exactly that these companies are turning over to the government, and what kinds of capabilities the government is wanting to access?', 'so we reported these discrepancies precisely because we want them -- those parties to resolve it in -- in public, in sunlight, and-- and let people decide whether or not thats the kind of country they want to live in when -- when the government can -- can get this massive amount of information.stephanopoulos: the dni spokesman also said that a crimes report has been filed by the national security agency.', 'have you been contacted by the fbi or any federal law enforcement official yet?greenwald: no.', 'and -- and any time they would like to speak to me, ill be more than happy to speak to them, and i will tell them that there is this thing called the constitution, and the very first amendment of which guarantees a free press.', 'as an american citizen, i have every right, and even the obligation as a journalist to tell my fellow citizens and -- and our readers what it is that the government is doing, that they dont want people in the united states to know about.', 'and im happy to talk to them at any time, and the attempt to intimidate journalists and sources with these constant threats of investigation arent going to work.stephanopoulos: you described your source as a reader of yours who trusted how you would handle the materials.', 'the source has also been described as a career government official, who was concerned about these programs.', 'a former prosecutor called the source a double-agent.', 'i know youre not going to reveal the source, obviously, but what more can you tell us about the individuals motivations?greenwald: well, first of all, i am not going to confirm that there is only one individual, there could be one or more than one.', 'but, let me first make this point, because i think this is so critical, because every time there is a whistle-blower, somebody who exposes government wrongdoing, the tactic of the government is to try and demonize them as a traitor.', 'they risk their careers, and their lives, and their liberty.', 'because what they were seeing being done in secret, inside the united states government is so alarming, and so pernicious that they simply want one thing.and that is for the american people, at least to learn about what this massive spying apparatus is, and what the capabilities are, so that we can have an open, honest debate about whether thats the kind of country that we want to live in.', 'and if the people decide that they -- yes, they do want the government knowing everything about them, intervening in all of their communications, monitoring them, keeping dossiers on them, then so be it.', 'but at least we should have that debate openly and democratically.', 'unfortunately, since the government hides virtually everything that they do at the threat of criminal prosecution, the only way for us to learn about them is through these courageous whistle-blowers who deserve our praise and gratitude and not imprisonment and prosecution.stephanopoulos: finally, should we be expecting more revelations from you?greenwald: you should.stephanopoulos: ok, glenn greenwald, thanks very much.stephanopoulos: now to the senator who says he did everything short of leaking classified information to shine a light on these surveillance programs.', 'here is mark udall on the senate floor more than two years ago.', '(begin video clip)udall: the intelligence community can target individuals who have no connection to terrorist organizations.', 'they can collect business records on law-abiding americans who have no connection to terrorism.', '(end video clip)stephanopoulos: and senator udall joins us from colorado this morning.', 'thank you for joining us, senator.', 'is everything were learning this week consistent with what you knew then?udall: it is, george, and as you pointed out, i tried to draw attention to what was happening over two years ago.', 'i am not happy that weve had leaks and these leaks are concerning, but i think its an opportunity now to have a discussion about the limits of surveillance, how we create transparency, and above all, how we protect americans privacy.stephanopoulos: well, what is your main concern here?', 'because the president has come out and said that that the programs are approved by congress, overseen by the courts, and carefully constrained.', 'here he was on friday.', '(begin video clip)obama: they are very focused, and in the abstract, you can complain about big brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, then i think weve struck the right balance.', '(end video clip)stephanopoulos: you dont believe the right balance has been struck?udall: i dont.', 'my main concern is americans dont know the extent to which they are being surveilled, george.', 'we hear this term metadata, which has to do with when you make calls, where you make calls to, who youre talking to.', 'i think thats private information, and i think if the government is gathering that, the american people ought to know it, we ought to have a discussion about it, and frankly, i think we ought to reopen the patriot act and put some limits on the amount of data that the national security administration is collecting.stephanopoulos: what kind of limits exactly?', 'because as the president pointed out, no one is listening to phone calls here, and they are not allowed to continue the targeting of any individual unless they have probable cause, unless they have developed some information that would give them a reason to continue with tracking.udall: my concern is, look, you know through a contract with your company that theyre going to collect this data, but the phone company cant arrest you, prosecute you, put you in jail.', 'and metadata, although it sounds simple and it sounds innocuous, can lead to a lot of additional information.', 'i just draw the line a little bit differently than the president does.', 'we do need to remember, were in a war against terrorists, and terrorism remains a real threat, but i also think we have to cue to the bill of rights, and the fourth amendment, which prevents unlawful searches and seizures, ought to be important to us.', 'it ought to remain sacred, and theres got to be a balance here.', 'that is what im aiming for.', 'lets have the debate, lets be transparent, lets open this up.', 'i dont think the american public knows the extent or knew the extent to which they were being surveilled and their data was being collected.stephanopoulos: but senator, the president has said that this has been fully debated and authorized by the congress.udall: it has been, george, but in a limited way, if i might make that point, and thats why i want to reopen the patriot act, i think now that this information is more available.', 'i certainly have a lot of coloradans say to me they are uncomfortable with this, they want to know more.', 'thats my point, is lets have a debate here, lets look at what is really happening.', 'its what i was trying to draw attention to two years ago.', 'millions of records every day being accumulated, makes me uneasy.', 'i think its a violation of our privacy.', 'lets take a further look at this.stephanopoulos: do you think that the administration has been straight with the congress in their testimonies?udall: you know, in general, i do.', 'and look, this is the law, but the way the law is being interpreted has really concerned me.', 'the law has been interpreted in a secret way.', 'thats what ive been calling for, is lets have full disclosure of how this law is being applied.', 'this isnt a scandal, but this is deeply concerning to me and a lot of americans, and frankly a lot of my colleagues in the senate on both sides of the aisle.stephanopoulos: and do you believe, though, that the program has been effective?', 'we had chairman mike rogers coming up saying, who said that this program has helped stop terrorist attacks, and (inaudible) reported that the subway, the attempted subway plot in new york subways in 2009 could have been stopped by this program.udall: george, i am not convinced, and by the way, there are two programs that are being discussed.', 'there is one the so-called prism program, article 702 in the law, and its been very effective.', 'it surveils foreigners, grabs content, photographs, emails.', 'the 215 provisions which are collecting all the metadata, i am not convinced that its uniquely valuable intelligence that we could not have generated in other ways.', 'so i know these claims are being made, but thats all the more reason to have a debate, to share this information and to determine whether or not we ought to be collecting millions of records every day of americans phone calls.', 'its just to me a violation of our privacy, particularly if its done in ways that we dont know about.stephanopoulos: senator udall, thanks for your time this morning.udall: hey, george, thanks for having me on.stephanopoulos: lets get a response now from the chairs of the intelligence committees, democrat dianne feinstein from the senate and republican mike rogers from the house.', 'and senator feinstein, let me begin with you.', 'you heard mr. greenwald and senator udall right there.', 'they believe that the balance between privacy and national security is out of whack with these programs.', 'your response.feinstein: well, of course, balance is a difficult thing to actually identify what it is, but i can tell you this: these programs are within the law.', 'the business records section is reviewed by a federal judge every 90 days.', 'it should be noted that the document that was released that was under seal, which reauthorized the program for another 90 days, came along with a second document that placed and discussed the strictures on the program.', 'that document was not released.so heres what happens with that program.', 'the program is essentially walled off within the nsa.', 'there are limited numbers of people who have access to it.', 'the only thing taken, as has been correctly expressed, is not content of a conversation, but the information that is generally on your telephone bill, which has been held not to be private personal property by the supreme court.if there is strong suspicion that a terrorist outside of the country is trying to reach someone on the inside of the country, those numbers then can be obtained.', 'if you want to collect content on the american, then a court order is issued.so, the program has been used.', 'two cases have been declassified.', 'one of them is the case of david headley, who went to mumbai, to the taj hotel, and scoped it out for the terrorist attack.the second is najibullah zazi, who lived in colorado, who made the decision that he was going to blow up a new york subway, who went to a beauty wholesale supply place, bought enough hydrogen peroxide to make bombs, was surveilled by the fbi for six months, traveled to go to new york, to meet with a number of other people who were going to carry out this attack with him, and were arrested by the fbi, who has pled guilty and in federal prison.here is the point.', 'and this is why this is so difficult.', 'i flew over world trade center going to senator lautenbergs funeral, and in the distance was the statue of liberty.', 'and i thought of those bodies jumping out of that building, hitting the canopy.', 'part of our obligation is keeping americans safe.', 'human intelligence isnt going to do it, because you cant -- its a different culture.', 'it is a fanaticism that isnt going to come forward.', 'and so, this kind of strict, strictly overseen -- its overseen by the justice department, by inspectors general, by audits, by a 90-day review, by the court, is looked at as a method.', 'im very happy if theres a better way, we will certainly look at it.stephanopoulos: let me bring that to congressman rogers, because you also said you believe these programs are effective, mr. chairman.rogers: i do.stephanopoulos: but what about this idea, raised by senator udall, that you reopen the patriot act, and put more limits on particularly the phone record collection program?', 'because he says that that hasnt helped.', 'that is his suspicion, at least.rogers: well, i can tell you, in the zazi case in new york, its exactly the program that was used.', 'and remember, all of these programs, this is really important, george, i mean, really important.', 'they are not -- the national security agency does not listen to americans phone calls and it is not reading americans emails.', 'none of these programs allow that.', 'as a matter of fact, the patriot act, part of that 702 says its expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic e-mail traffic in the united states.', 'so the inflammatory nature of the comments does not fit with what dianne and i know this program really does.', 'and lets just talk about the phone records just real quickly.', 'what this is, and the reason this happened is after 9/11, we realized there was a big hole in our ability to fully identify all of the players in that terrorist plot.', 'and one of it was by the fact that these business records, the phone billing information, is destroyed by these companies.', 'they cant, expense-wise, its really difficult for them to hold them.', 'so this is what happened.', 'the court said, put all of that information in a box and hold that information, and when you want to access that information, you have to use this very specific court-ordered approval process, which means it has to be a foreign person believed to be on a foreign land.', 'so some notion that they can see a name that even comes out of that -- by the way, this is important -- no name comes out of that search.', 'so even if they get a number, it doesnt have a name on it.', 'this then allows them to do further investigation.but the number of times its accessed is very -- it is a fraction of a fraction, number one.', 'and number two, no one can data mine that information.', 'that is whats so frustrating to those of us who know this program.stephanopoulos: but thats what i was just going to get to.', 'both of you know so much more than any other americans.', 'one of the things you heard from senator udall is the desire for more public information.', 'now, he believes that the administration hasnt been misleading generally the committee and the public, but i want to play an exchange, it was in the intelligence committee in march, when james clapper was questioned by your colleague, senator wyden.', '(begin video clip)sen. ron wyden, d-oregon: does the nsa collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of americans?james clapper, dni: no, sir.wyden: it does not?clapper: not wittingly.', 'there are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.', '(end video clip)stephanopoulos: senator feinstein, i have to confess, i have a hard time squaring that answer with what we learned this week.feinstein: well, i think this is very hard.', 'there is no more direct or honest person than jim clapper, and i think both mike and i know that.', 'you can misunderstand the question.', 'this is one of the dilemmas of talking about it.', 'he could have thought the question had content or something, but it is true that this is a wide collection of phone records, as mike said.', 'no name, no content.', 'but the number to number, the length of time, the kind of thing thats on the telephone bill, and we have to deal with that.stephanopoulos: so, what do we do going forward?', 'senator mccain has said, and we heard senator udall as well, that maybe there should be a public hearing on this program and the range of the programs that are surveilling, that includes some surveillance of some data from americans.', 'are you open to that, senator feinstein?', 'and chairman rogers, you comment as well.feinstein: yeah, i am open to it.', 'and i have to think about this.', 'we had an intelligence committee meeting on thursday, which i opened up to everybody and 27 senators came.', 'you know, we informed them that every senator, the material is available.', 'they can come and see it.one of the structures of highly classified with no stuff is no staff.', 'i think that should be changed so that intelligence committee staff can come in with the member and go over and review the material.but we have had lots of hearings on this.', 'and i think senator wyden knows this and has been respectful of it.and im open to doing a hearing every month if thats necessary.', 'and im open to doing to doing an opening hearing now.heres the rub, the instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks is all classified, thats whats so hard about this.', 'so that we cant actually go in there and other than the two that have been released give the public an actual idea of people that have been saved, attacks that have been prevented, that kind of thing.stephanopoulos: chairman rogers?rogers: you know, george, one of the things that were charged with is keeping america safe and keeping our civil liberties and privacy intact.', 'i think we have done both in this particular case.', 'and the problem with this is, if you tell our adversaries and enemies in the counterterrorism fight exactly how we conduct business, they are not going to business the same ever again.', 'it makes it more difficult.and so each one of these programs -- and i think the zazi case is so important, because thats one you can specifically show that this was the key piece that allowed us to stop a bombing in the new york subway system.but these programs, that authorized by the court by the way, only focused on non-united states persons overseas, that gets lost in this debate, are pieces of the puzzle.', 'and you have to have all of the pieces of the puzzle to try to put it together.', 'thats what we found went wrong in 9/11.and we didnt have all of the pieces of the puzzle, we found out subsequently, to the boston bombings, either.', 'and so had we had more pieces of the puzzle you can stop these things before they happen.stephanopoulos: finally, were just about -- sorry, were just about out of time.', 'i just want a quick answer from each of you on this.', 'we saw that a crimes investigation has been opened.', 'is it fair to say that both of you believe that this investigation should be pursued and the source, if found, should be prosecuted?rogers: i absolutely believe that someone did not have authorization to release this information.', 'and why thats so important, george, is because they didnt have all of the information.', 'i know your reported that you interviewed, greenwald, says that hes got it all and now is an expert on the program.', 'he doesnt have a clue how this thing works.', 'nether did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous.i argue that theres other methods.', 'he could come to the committees, if they had concern.', 'we have igs that they can go to in a classified way if they have concern.', 'taking a very sensitive classified program that targets foreign person on foreign lands, and putting just enough out there to be dangerous, is dangerous to us, its dangerous to our national security and it violates the oath of which that person took.', 'i absolutely think they should be prosecuted.stephanopoulos: you too, senator feinstein?feinstein: i do.stephanopoulos: thank you both for your time this

motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?the answer may never be known, but castile’s stop for a broken tail light wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban st. paul police officer, and castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.the shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after castile died, a black army veteran killed five officers in dallas at a demonstration over castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in louisiana.the castile video “is pretty horrific,” said gavin

fighting for and why.', 'the first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as i said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries.', 'thats how this area was built.', 'thats how america prospered.', 'because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.now, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of american manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down.', 'thats the good news.', '(applause.)',

states.', '(applause.', ')and something that cheri and i were talking about on the way over here -- i’m going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs.', 'so let’s tell the world that america is open for business.', '(applause.)', 'i know there’s an old site right here in galesburg, over on monmouth boulevard -- let’s put some folks to work.', '(applause.', ')tomorrow, i’ll also visit the port of jacksonville, florida to offer new ideas for doing what america has always done best, which is building things.', 'pat and i were talking before i came -- backstage -- pat quinn -- he was talking about how i came over the don moffitt bridge.', '(applause.)', 'but we’ve got work to do all across the country.', 'we’ve got ports that aren’t ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new panama canal in two years’ time.', 'if we don’t get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else.', 'we’ve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for medicare.', '(laughter and applause.', ')businesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks.', 'and rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can’t be outsourced.', '(applause.', ')and by the way, this isn’t a democratic idea.', 'republicans built a lot of stuff.', 'this is the land of lincoln.', 'lincoln was all about building stuff -- first republican president.', '(applause.)', 'and yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago.', 'and that’s inefficient at a time when it’s as cheap as it’s been since the 1950s to build things.', 'it’s inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.the longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be.', 'businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports.', 'they’ll relocate to places with high-speed internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because we’ll be eliminating some of these traffic jams.', 'and we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the united states.', '(applause.', ')in an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they’ll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- they’ll reward those folks with good pay.the days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over.', 'everybody here knows that.', 'there are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn’t need a high school education.', 'you could just go there.', 'if you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs.', 'and you could

resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what america has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win.', 'that’s what we have to do.', '(applause.',

they’re going to face.', '(applause.)', 'and if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century.', '(laughter and applause.', ')if we don’t make this investment, we’re going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades.', 'so we have to begin in the earliest years.', 'and that’s why i’m going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in america.', '(applause.)', 'not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.and i’m going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don’t require congress.', '(applause.)', 'so, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of america’s students to high-speed internet over the next five years.', 'we’re making that happen right now.', '(applause.)', 'we’ve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.and we’re also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs.', 'so here in galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at carl sandburg college.', '(applause.)', 'and while it didn’t pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.and that’s why i’ve asked congress to start a community college to career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown.', '(applause.)', 'and i’m going to challenge ceos from some of america’s best companies to hire more americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their résumé an honest look.audience member: more talent!the president: that, too.i’m also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that’s straining the budgets of just about every american family -- and that’s the soaring cost of higher education.', '(applause.)', 'everybody is touched by this, including your president, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off.', '(laughter.', ')three years ago, i worked with democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college.', '(applause.)', 'then, i capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn’t pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved.', 'that’s in place right now.', '(applause.)', 'and this week, we’re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction.', '(applause.', ')so this is all a good start -- but it isn’t enough.', 'families and taxpayers can’t just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up.', 'we’ll never have enough loan money, we’ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year.', 'we’ve got to get more out of what we pay for.now, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time.', 'in some states, they’re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.so this afternoon, i’ll visit the university of central missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students.', 'and in the coming months, i will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families.', 'it is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single american who’s willing to work for it.', '(applause.', ')now, so you’ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class.', 'but a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security.', 'for most families, that’s your biggest asset.', 'for most families, that’s where your life’s work has been invested.', 'and that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting.', 'the good news is over the past four years, we’ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes.', 'and today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer americans see their homes underwater.but we’re not done yet.', 'the key now is to encourage homeownership that isn’t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.so already, i’ve asked congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by mitt romney’s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year.', '(applause.)', 'it will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.i’m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no.', 'we’ll work with both parties to turn the page on fannie mae and freddie mac, and build a housing finance system that’s rock-solid for future generations.so we’ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country.', 'but along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement.', '(applause.)', 'i hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp.', 'it’s getting farther and farther away.', 'they cant see it.now, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered.', 'but we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all.', 'so as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they wont be able to retire.', '(applause.', ')and if congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, i should just say they don’t have to look far.', 'we mentioned immigration reform before.', 'economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the social security system for years.', 'so we should get that done.', '(applause.', ')good job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.fifth, im going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you’ve worked a lifetime to build.as we speak, were well on our way to fully implementing the affordable care act.', '(applause.)', 'were going to implement it.', 'now, if you’re one of the 85 percent of americans who already have health insurance either through the job or medicare or medicaid, you don’t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before.', 'you may not know it, but you do.', 'free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if youre on medicare -- that’s what the affordable care act means.', 'youre already getting a better deal.', 'no lifetime limits.if you don’t have health insurance, then starting on october 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and youll be able to comparison-shop online.', 'there will be a marketplace online, just like you’d buy a flat-screen tv or plane tickets or anything else youre doing online, and youll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.and if youre one of the up to half of all americans who’ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning january 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition.', '(applause.)', 'that’s what the affordable care act does.', 'that’s what it does.', '(applause.', ')now, look, i know because ive been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail.', 'and i don’t always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don’t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that’s a bad thing.', 'but despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.so just last week, new york announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what theyre paying today -- 50 percent lower.', '(applause.)', 'so folks premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent.', 'and for them and for the millions of americans who’ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are 25 or 26 stay on their parents plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, youll have the security of knowing that everything you’ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out.', '(applause.', ')finally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- i’m going to make the case for why weve got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those americans who havent quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work.', '(applause.', ')there are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty.', 'here in america, we’ve never guaranteed success -- thats not what we do.', 'more than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant.', 'nobody is going to do something for you.', '(applause.)', 'weve tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy.', 'thats all for the good.', 'but that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if youre willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too.', 'thats the american idea.', '(applause.', ')unfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in america have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years.', 'and that’s a betrayal of the american idea.', 'and that’s why we have to do a lot more to give every american the chance to work their way into the middle class.the best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community.', 'so we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods.', '(applause.)', 'we need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in america to get them back on their feet.', 'and because no one who works full-time in america should have to live in poverty, i am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because its lower right now than it was when ronald reagan took office.', 'its time for the minimum wage to go up.', '(applause.', ')were not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life’s biggest winners or losers.', 'and after years in which we’ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in galesburg, folks in the quad cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break.', 'a plant leaves.', 'somebody gets sick.', 'somebody loses a home.', 'weve seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors.', 'weve seen it happen.', 'and that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.so good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- thats where i will focus my energies.', '(applause.)', 'thats where i will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.these are the plans that ill lay out across this country.', 'but i won’t be able to do it alone, so im going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause.', 'we’ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure congress to invest in our future.', 'and i’ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees.', 'and i’m going to highlight the ones that do just that.there are companies like costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits.', '(applause.)', 'companies like -- there are companies like the container store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it’s not just good for the employees, it’s good for their businesses to treat workers well.', 'it’s good for america.', '(applause.', ')so i’m going to be calling on the private sector to step up.', 'i will be saying to democrats we’ve got to question some of our old assumptions.', 'we’ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that dont work as well as they should.', '(applause.)', 'we’ve got to be willing to -- we’ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age.', 'we cant just -- democrats cant just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing.', 'if we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and i believe that -- we’ve an obligation to prove it.', 'and that means that we’ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.and we’ll need republicans in congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground.', '(applause.', ')it’s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, mr. president, these are all good ideas, but some of you’ve said before; some of them sound great, but you cant get those through congress.', 'republicans won’t agree with you.', 'and i say, look, the fact is there are republicans in congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas i’ll be proposing.', 'i know because they’ve said so.', 'but they worry they’ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.now, there are others who will dismiss every idea i put forward either because they’re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for america -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.in either case, i say to these members of congress: i’m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot.', 'so now it’s time for you to lay out your ideas.', '(applause.)', 'you cant just be against something.', 'you got to be for something.', '(applause.', ')even if you think i’ve done everything wrong, the trends i just talked about were happening well before i took office.', 'so it’s not enough for you just to oppose me.', 'you got to be for something.', 'what are your ideas?', 'if you’re willing to work with me to strengthen american manufacturing and rebuild this country’s infrastructure, let’s go.', 'if you’ve got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let’s hear them.', 'if you think you have a better plan for making sure that every american has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes, and share your concrete ideas with the country.', '(applause.', ')repealing obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan.', 'it’s not.if you’re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you’re interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, i’m ready to work.', '(applause.)', 'but you should know that i will not accept deals that don’t meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hardworking families.', 'this is the agenda we have to be working on.', '(applause.', ')we’ve come a long way since i first took office.', '(applause.)', 'as a country, we’re older and wiser.', 'i don’t know if i’m wiser, but i’m certainly older.', '(laughter.)', 'and as long as congress doesn’t manufacture another crisis -- as long as we don’t shut down the government just because i’m for keeping it open -- (laughter) -- as long as we don’t risk a u.s. default over paying bills that we’ve already racked up, something that we’ve never done -- we can probably muddle along without taking bold action.', 'if we stand pat and we don’t do any of the things i talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should.', 'new businesses will form.', 'the unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit.', 'just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, america will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by.but you know what, that’s our choice.', 'if we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change, understand that part of our character will be lost.', 'our founding precepts about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last -- that will be a myth, not reality.', 'the position of the middle class will erode further.', 'inequality will continue to increase.', 'money’s power will distort our politics even more.social tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have, or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn’t improving.', 'and the fundamental optimism that’s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia.and that’s not the vision i have for this country.', 'it’s not the vision you have for this country.', 'that’s not the america we know.', 'that’s not the vision we should be settling for.', 'that’s not a vision we should be passing on to our children.i have now run my last campaign.', 'i do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next president before tackling the issues that matter.', 'i care about one thing and one thing only, and that’s how to use every minute -- (applause)

care about.', 'i don’t have another election.', '(applause.', ')because i’ll tell you, galesburg, that’s where i believe america needs to go.', 'i believe that’s where the american people want to go.', 'and it may seem hard today, but if we’re willing to take a few bold steps -- if washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we’ve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now.', 'it will be stronger five years from now.', 'it will be stronger 10 years

their lives, and who think government should take care of them.', 'fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in november, romney replied:there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.', 'all right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.', 'that that’s an entitlement.', 'and the government should give it to them.', 'and they will vote for this president no matter what…these are people who pay no income tax.romney went on: “[m]y job is is not to worry about those people.', 'i’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”mother jones has obtained video of romney at this intimate fundraiser—where he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in public—and has confirmed its authenticity.', 'to protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after romney had clinched the republican presidential nomination.', '[update: we can now report that this fundraiser was held at the boca raton home of controversial private equity manager marc leder on may 17, and we’ve removed the blurring from the video.', 'see the original blurred videos here.', ']here is romney expressing his disdain for americans who back the president:at the dinner, romney often stuck to familiar talking points.', 'but there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines.', 'describing his family background, he quipped about his father, “had he been born of mexican parents, i’d have a better shot of winning this.” contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, romney insisted, “i have inherited nothing.” he remarked, “there is a perception, ‘oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.’ frankly, i was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in america.”romney told the contributors that “women are open to supporting me,” but that “we are having a much harder time with hispanic voters, and if the hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the democrats as the african american voting block has in the past, why, we’re in trouble as a party and, i think, as a nation.” when one attendee asked how this group could help romney sell himself to others, he answered, “frankly, what i need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.” he added, “the fact that i’m either tied or close to the president…that’s very interesting.”asked why he wouldn’t go full-throttle and assail obama as corrupt, romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for obama in 2008:we speak with voters across the country about their perceptions.', 'those people i told you—the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side—they all voted for barack obama four years ago.', 'so, and by the way, when you say to them, “do you think barack obama is a failure?” they overwhelmingly say no.', 'they like him.', 'but when you say, “are you disappointed that his policies haven’t worked?” they say yes.', 'and because they voted for him, they don’t want to be told that they were wrong, that he’s a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he’s corrupt.', 'those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasn’t up to the task.', 'they love the phrase that he’s “over his head.” but if we’re—but we, but you see, you and i, we spend our day with republicans.', 'we spend our days with people who agree with us.', 'and these people are people who voted for him and don’t agree with us.', 'and so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them.', 'and the best success i have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment.', 'he told you he’d keep unemployment below 8 percent.', 'hasn’t been below eight percent since.', 'fifty percent of kids coming out of school can’t get a job.', 'fifty percent.', 'fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won’t graduate from high school.', 'what’re they gonna do?', 'these are the kinds of things that i can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, “yeah, i think you’re right.” what he’s going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone who’s been successful, or who’s, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy.', 'and that may work.', '(note: obama did not promise his policies would keep unemployment under 8 percent, and 50 percent of college graduates are not unemployed.', ')to assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu:i have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particular who have done races around the world.', 'i didn’t realize it.', 'these guys in the us—the karl rove equivalents—they do races all over the world: in armenia, in africa, in israel.', 'i mean, they work for bibi netanyahu in his race.', 'so they do these races and they see which ads work, and which processes work best, and we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign.', 'i’d tell them to you, but i’d have to shoot you.when one donor said he was disappointed that romney wasn’t attacking obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments:well, i wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book.', 'we have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that i care about.', 'i have to tell you, i don’t think this will have a significant impact on my electability.', 'i wish it did.', 'i think our ads will have a much bigger impact.', 'i think the debates will have a big impact…my dad used to say, “being right early is not good in politics.” and in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subject—discussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesn’t win elections.', 'and there are, there are, there are—for instance, this president won because of “hope and change.”romney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall:they’ll probably be looking at what the polls are saying.', 'if it looks like i’m going to win, the markets will be happy.', 'if it looks like the president’s going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy.', 'it depends of course which markets you’re talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on november 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country.', 'we’ll see capital come back and we’ll see—without actually doing anything—we’ll actually get a boost in the economy.', 'if the president gets reelected, i don’t know what will happen.', 'i can—i can never predict what the markets will do.', 'sometimes it does the exact opposite of what i would have expected.', 'but my own view is that if we get a “taxageddon,” as they call it, january 1st, with this president, and with a congress that can’t work together, it’s—it really is frightening.advertise on motherjones.comat the dinner, romney also said that the campaign purposefully was using ann romney “sparingly…so that people don’t get tired of her.” and he noted that he had turned down an invitation from saturday night live because such an appearance “has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential.”here was romney raw and unplugged—sort of unscripted.', 'with this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open.', 'he displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who don’t contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative.', 'yet romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election.', 'these were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real romney.also read: more from the secret romney video.', '(romney tells his donors he doesn’t believe in a two-state solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict, that resolving

describe as a highly polarized situation is a very big difference of opinion.', 'the republicans are here for the special interests, were here for the peoples interests.', 'the president said we will measure our progress, our success, by the progress that is made by americas working families.', 'that is our priority.', 'that is not their priority.this isnt about inter-party bickering.', 'this is about a major philosophical difference as to whose side youre on.', 'you dont like to think that.', 'we come here to find our common ground.', 'thats our responsibility.', 'but if we cant find it, we still have to move.', 'ive never voted for a perfect bill in my life.', 'i dont think anyone has i wish it were not so stark.', 'i wish the elections werent so necessary for us to win.', 'i really do, because it should be -- there should be more common ground.', 'are we unhappy that our not -- the -- the job creation has not gone as fast as we would like?', 'well, we were digging out of a very deep hole.', 'but we will continue to fight.amanpour: speaker pelosi, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.pelosi: well, i look forward to welcoming you back soon again.', 'and congratulations to you and much success.amanpour: thank you.amanpour: secretary gates, thank you very much for joining us and welcome to this week.gates: thank you.amanpour: lets start with wikileaks.how can an ordinary soldier sitting at his computer, apparently listening to lady gaga or whatever, spew all this stuff out with nobody knowing?gates: its -- its an -- its an interesting question, because had -- had he tried to do this or had whoever did this tried to do it at a -- a rear headquarters, overseas or in pretty much anywhere here in the u.s., we have controls in place that would have allowed us to detect it.', 'but one of the changes that has happened as we have fought these wars in iraq and afghanistan has been an effort to put the -- put as much information and intelligence as far forward to the soldiers as we possibly can, so that at a forward operating base, they -- they know what the security risks are to them and they -- and they also have information to help them accomplish their mission.so -- so we put an enormous amount of information out at a -- at the secret level and push it the furthest forward possible.', 'and so it is this -- it -- it was much easier to do in theater and in afghanistan or iraq than it would have been at a rear headquarters or here in the u.s.amanpour: so do you now have to reassess that -- much less intelligence going to the forward bases?gates: i think we have to look at it, although i must say, my bias is that if one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the front lines by denying them information in an effort to try and prevent this from happening -- my bias is against that.', 'i want those kids out there to have all the information they can have.and so were going to look at are there ways in which we can mitigate the risk, but without denying the forward soldiers the information.amanpour: how angry were you -- beyond the fact that classified information is out there -- the substance of it?gates: well, im not sure anger is the right word.', 'i just -- i think mortified, appalled.', 'and -- and if -- if im angry, it is -- it is because i believe that this information puts those in afghanistan who have helped us at risk.', 'it puts our soldiers at risk because they can learn a lot -- our adversaries can learn a lot about our techniques, tactics and procedures from the body of these leaked documents.', 'and so i think thats what puts our soldiers at risk.and -- and then, as i say, our sources.', 'and, you know, growing up in the intelligence business, protecting your sources is sacrosanct.', 'and -- and there was no sense of responsibility or accountability associated with it.amanpour: you know, you talk about putting your sources at risk, a taliban spokesman has told a british news organization that they are, indeed, going to go after any of those names that they find in this treasure trove of documents and they will, as they say, they know how to deal with people.are you worried?i mean admiral mullen said that this leak basically has blood on its hands?gates: well, i mean given the talibans statement, i think it -- it basically proves the point.', 'and my attitude on this is that there are two -- two areas of culpability.', 'one is legal culpability.', 'and thats up to the justice department and others.', 'thats not my arena.', 'but theres also a moral culpability.', 'and thats where i think the verdict is guilty on wikileaks.', 'they have put this out without any regard whatsoever for the consequences.amanpour: so let me ask you about a couple of things that came out.', 'one is the possibility that the taliban may have stinger missiles.do they, do you think?gates: i dont think so.amanpour: at all?gates: i dont think so.amanpour: the other is about pakistan.', 'again raising the notion that pakistan, no matter how much you say theyre, you know, moving in your direction, helping with this fight against the taliban and against al qaeda, that they still are hedging their bets, that elements in pakistan continue to hedge their bets or out and out support the taliban and what theyre doing in afghanistan.how much of a problem is that for you?gates: well, it -- it is a concern, theres no question about it.', 'but -- but i would say that, again, we walked out on pakistan and afghanistan in 1989 and left them basically holding the bag.', 'and -- and there is always the fear that we will do that again.', 'and i believe thats the reason theres a certain hedge.but what i see is a change in the strategic calculus in pakistan.', 'as they see these groups attacking pakistan itself, where they are more and more partnering with us and working with us and fighting these insurgents and 140,000 soldiers in northwestern pakistan fighting some of the same insurgents we are.amanpour: right.', 'but theyre basically fighting the insurgents that are threatening them.', 'they havent gone into, for instance, these safe havens which still exist, northern waziristan.', 'and general jones, the national security adviser, has told the washington post that these safe havens are a big question mark in terms of our success rate.so unless they do that, cut off those safe havens, will you succeed in afghanistan?gates: well, i think we can but --amanpour: even if the safe havens --gates: -- but we clearly --amanpour: -- exist?gates: -- we clearly would like for them to go after the safe havens.', 'but they have gone after the safe haven -- some of the safe havens, in south waziristan and swat and elsewhere, places where, 18 months ago, i wouldnt have believed the pakistanis would be actively engaged -- and militarily.and so the pakistanis going after any of these groups, i believe, overall, helps us in what were trying to accomplish, both with respect to afghanistan and with respect to al qaeda.amanpour: but given the way the war is going right now and given the fact that the taliban are very wily and very adaptable enemies and they do have a place where they can go across the border and hide, can you afford to wait for the pakistanis to -- to move on into northern waziristan?gates: i think that the -- first of all, we are increasing our cooperation with the pakistanis in terms of working on both sides of the border, in terms of trying to prevent people from crossing that border.', 'we are increasing our forces in eastern afghanistan that will help us do this.', 'so i think that -- i think were moving in the right direction here.amanpour: but you dont have an open-ended period of time.', 'the president has clearly said that the summer of 2011 is a period of transition.', 'and many people are interpreting that in all sorts of different ways, as you know.the taliban is clearly running out the clock -- its trying to run out the clock.let me put something up that david kilcullen, the counter-insurgency expert, a former adviser to general petraeus, said about the timetable.', '(begin video clip)david kilcullen: they believe that we had stated a date certain, that we were going to leave in the summer of 2011. and they immediately went out and spoke to the population and said, the americans are leaving in 18 months, as it was then.', 'what are you doing on the 19th month?', 'who are you backing?', 'because well still be there and they wont be.', '(end video clip)amanpour: so that question is out there.', 'so many people are arranging their schedules for 2011 -- the summer of 2011.but my question to you is this, what can general petraeus do to defeat the taliban at their own game?what can he do now in afghanistan to avoid this deadline that theyre setting for themselves?gates: well, first of all, i think we need to re-emphasize the message that we are not leaving afghanistan in july of 2011. we are beginning a transition process and a thinning of our ranks that will -- and the pace will depend on the conditions on the ground.', 'the president has been very clear about that.', 'and if the taliban are waiting for the nineteenth month, i welcome that, because we will be there in the nineteenth month and we will be there with a lot of troops.', 'so i think that --amanpour: but what is a lot of troops?gates: well, first of all, i think that -- my personal opinion is that -- that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers.', 'and as we are successful, well probably accelerate.', 'but, again, its -- it will depend on the conditions on the ground.amanpour: is there any way now -- between now and december, between now and next -- next summer, to deliver some high profile, real reconstruction, real sort of progress to them to make everybody know that youre serious and to change the dynamic?', 'gates: well, first of all, i think were already seeing that.', 'were already seeing it in central helmand, where security development and governance, economic returning.', 'we are seeing it in places like nad ali.', 'were actually seeing it in places like marjah, that has been slower and tougher than we anticipated, but its getting better every day.', 'and were seeing it in gradually improving security in the area around kandahar.', 'its going to take some time.', 'its going to be tough.', 'were going to take casualties.', 'we have warned about this for months, that this summer would be very difficult for us.', 'but i think there are tangible signs that this approach is working, this strategy is working.', 'but the key thing to remember is the full surge isnt even all i afghanistan yet and will not be until the end of august.', 'so this surge over the last few months is only beginning to take effect.', 'amanpour: what i think a lot of people maybe dont get is that the afghan people still want the american forces there.', 'in the latest abc poll, it shows that 68 percent of the afghan people actually want the american forces still there.do you think that there has been an opportunity missed or should there be an opportunity seized by yourself, maybe by the president, to go out and speak to the american people more about -- about afghanistan, about the strategy, about why its important?gates: well, first of all, im here.', 'and i think the president has been out and has spoken about this.', 'he talked about it in some detail at the time he nominated general petraeus, about where we were headed.probably we can do more.', 'but secretary clinton and i and the president and the vice president and general jones have all been out and -- and talking about this.', 'and -- and i think -- you know, frankly, one of the things that i find frustrating is that i think that the presidents strategy is really quite clear.', 'i hear -- i hear all the stories that say whats the strategy, whats the goal here?i think its quite clear.', 'its to -- its to reverse the momentum of the taliban, deny them control of populated areas, degrade their capabilities at the same time were building up the afghan security forces, so that the afghan security forces can deny the taliban and al qaeda a base from which to attack the united states and the west.amanpour: all right.gates: its pretty straightforward.amanpour: ok. then let me -- since you brought that up, i want to bring up what vice president biden told nbc earlier this week about the strategy and about -- about the aims, because, again, i think the american people and many people are confused about what is the -- what is winning, what is the strategy right now?let me put that up.', '(begin video clip)joseph biden, vice president of the united states: we are in afghanistan for one express purpose -- al qaeda.', 'the threat to the united states -- al qaeda that exists in those mountains between afghanistan and pakistan.', 'we are not there to nation-build.', '(end video clip)amanpour: is that it?gates: thats good.amanpour: is that the war?gates: i agree with that.', 'we are not there to -- to take on a nationwide reconstruction or construction project in afghanistan.', 'what we have to do is focus our efforts on those civilian aspects and governance to help us accomplish our se -- our security objective.we are in afghanistan because we were attacked from afghanistan, not because we want to try and -- and build a better society in afghanistan.but doing things to improve governance, to improve development in afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the effectiveness of the afghan government in the security arena, thats what were going to do.amanpour: a final question, do you think the way out is to strike a deal with the taliban?gates: i think that the -- i think that the way out is to improve the security situation in afghanistan to the point -- and to degrade the taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the afghan government -- detaching themselves from al qaeda, agreeing that -- to under -- abide by the afghan constitution, agreeing to put down their weapons.', 'i think those are the -- those are the conditions that -- that need to -- reconciliation must take -- must be the end game here.', 'but it must take place on the terms of the afghan government.amanpour: and you think that can happen in -- in a year?gates: well, were not limited to a year.', 'i think that it can happen in the time frame that were looking at ahead.', 'again, july 2011 is not the end.', 'it is the beginning of a transition.amanpour: secretary gates, thank you so much for joining us.gates: thanks a lot.amanpour: thank you.', '(commercial break)(begin video clip)(unknown): wikileaks, along with three major newspapers, has published 92,000 classified intelligence documents, the largest leak in history.gibbs: there are names.', 'there are operations.', 'theres logistics.', 'it poses a very real and potential threat.', '(unknown): im a combative person, so i wanted (inaudible)mullen: the truth is, they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an afghan family.', '(end video clip)amanpour: highlights from the wikileaks story thats really shaken up washington and capitals around the world.', 'well talk about that and more on our roundtable with george will, democratic strategist donna brazile, paul krugman of the new york times, and in madrid this morning, ahmed rashid, the pakistani journalist who is the world authority on the taliban.thank you all for joining us this morning.', 'let me go to you first, george.', 'what about this leak?', 'how bad is it for the war effort?', 'and how bad is it for a government which really has to reassess what it does with state secrets?will: well, these were lethal without being helpful, lethal in the sense that they compromised both methods and, more important, sources themselves.', 'not helping, in the sense that theyre not a bit like the pentagon papers, which showed in the vietnam war that the government internally had a very different understanding of what was going on in vietnam than it was saying publicly.thats not the case here.', 'these are redundant anecdotes about what we all knew from good journalism and honest government about this.what were left with now is still the question of the mission.', 'in your interview with secretary gates, he said the following: we are in afghanistan because we were attacked from afghanistan.', 'notice the preposition.', 'we werent attacked by afghanistan, in the sense that we were attacked by japan at pearl harbor.', 'we were attacked from there.and national security adviser james jones has said that we have to be there because otherwise the terrorists would have more space to plot and train.amanpour: exactly.will: we were attacked from hamburg, in a sense.', 'you can plot in this kind of war anywhere.amanpour: well, yes, but the real ground war is in afghanistan.and let me go to ahmed rashid, who is the authority on the taliban.', 'ahmed, what is your assessment of how wikileaks and all the material and information that came out of that could affect the war?rashid: well, again, i dont think that there has been any really major new information given in these wikileaks.', 'the impact has been quite extraordinary in america, in europe, and other places simply because this war has not really been properly followed by the public.the media has not followed it.', 'and as a result, i think people are being quite shocked about the degree of detail and content that have come out.', 'but i dont think anything drastically new has come out.', 'now there is a risk of sources, et cetera, which the taliban are going to follow up on.amanpour: precisely.', 'and i wanted to ask you about that.', 'you know already they have said that theyre going to be searching and scouring this treasure trove.', 'do you -- do you foresee that there are going to be bodies turning up in afghanistan amongst people whove really been helping the united states?rashid: well, i hope that, you know, these -- a lot of these leaks are quite old, and people have moved on.', 'a lot of the names may be false names.', 'i hope were not going to see bodies, but certainly this is something -- the taliban are extremely good at following debates in the west, the western media, debates in parliaments in europe, in the congress.', 'they will have seen this new vote just now, where so many of the democrats seem to be voting against the war.they are expert now at following up.', 'and if there are people to be followed up upon, they will do so.amanpour: well, let me put that to donna brazile and to paul krugman.', 'the idea that they are really smart, they read the western press, they have a very highly sophisticated, whether we like to think that or not, media operation.brazile: well, it put the afghanistan war back on the front page, the longest war in united states history.', 'voters are weary of this war right now.', 'congress is -- is worried about the funding, the strategy.i think this will give the administration an opportunity to once again talk about the mission, before december, when the president has announced that he intends to reassess what theyre doing.i also think it raises a serious question about pakistans involvement with the taliban and also whether or not mr. karzai is still up to the job of bringing the government together, reinforcing the police and the army.', 'it raises a serious question about going forward and the timetable.krugman: you know, when i look at this, people say, you know, we cant abandon afghanistan, all that.', 'im surprised that people arent pointing out that basically the decision to abandon afghanistan was taken eight years ago, right?', 'eight years ago, when the taliban was on the run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this, thats when the bush administration pulled the troops out of afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade iraq instead.and now youre asking us to -- youre asking obama to recover from a situation where weve spent eight years losing credibility.amanpour: but the thing is, he is trying to recover.', 'hes had this big strategy.', 'hes made a surge in afghanistan.', 'and right now, for instance, bill kristol of the weekly standard has written a memo to president obama, basically saying rescind the 2011 -- the 2011 deadline.', 'what do you think has to happen to make this war winnable for the united states?will: well, first of all, in his remarks to you, secretary gates semi-rescinded it, by saying that, in fact, what comes in july 11 -- 2011 is fairly limited numbers of withdrawal.', 'thats making it a fairly elastic deadline.but look what -- and our friend in madrid can comment on this.', 'secretary gates said to you today, our purpose is to degrade the taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the afghan government.', 'now, that, a, sounds like surrender, and, b, the normal afghan would say, give me a third choice, because i dont like the afghan government, either.amanpour: right.', 'ahmed rashid, how did you read that, that the taliban is expected to surrender or come into a reconciliation on the terms of the karzai government?rashid: well, i think this is going to be the very big debate that takes place within the obama administration come december, when the policy review takes place, because the other position to this is that, in fact, the u.s. should start talks with the taliban as soon as possible, and that will then trigger up much better attempts to try and bring about a regional cohesion, a regional alliance to support those talks.the taliban, with all their interlocutors that theyve been talking to so far, have made it clear that they want to talk to the americans directly.', 'now, any such talks cant be based on conditions set by america, as gates has just done.', 'they would have to be free and open talks, and they would have to continue for some time.so i think once you have a dialogue going with the taliban, then you, i think, can go to the pakistanis and the isi and tell them, now, look, were talking to the taliban.', 'this is the end game now.', 'the surges will continue.', 'talks will continue.', 'but you now have to give a deadline for the end of these safe havens for the taliban leaders.in other words, the taliban leaders should know that their safe havens will only have a limited timeframe and negotiations will also have a limited timeframe.amanpour: well, lots and lots to talk about on this particular issue, but lets move on a little bit.', 'i actually asked speaker nancy pelosi about afghanistan, about the war vote, the war funding vote in the house, and whether she thought that the president needed to come out and speak more to the country about afghanistan.', 'this is what she said to me.', 'listen.', '(begin video clip)pelosi: theyre worried about their economic security, and thats what they want to hear from the president, is how we can increase -- create jobs in our country as we reduce the deficit.', '(end video clip)amanpour: so there you have it.', 'economic security, obviously, is the number-one preoccupation, as it always would be wherever there is these huge problems of unemployment.', 'there is a huge debate right now, all leading economists basically disagree on how and what effect stimulus has had, what it means for future economic policy.', 'is it deficit reduction austerity?', 'is it more stimulus?', 'where do we go and what does it mean to people?krugman: well, what it means to people, i think, is a lot of confusion, which is -- which is a problem, right?', 'theyre not hearing any clear message.you know, the way i look at it is that there are two sides in this debate -- i call them inflationistas and deflationistas -- that were -- one side, the inflationistas, have said, oh, god, we have this -- we have budget deficits.', 'the fed is printing money.', 'were going to have inflation.', 'interest rates are going to go sky-high.the deflationistas have said, you know, that weve had a major financial crisis.', 'in the fact of that, the obama stimulus plan is too small, interest rates are going to stay low because nobody wants to spend, the -- you know, that the risk is deflation.so far, the deflationistas have been totally right.', 'whats interesting is that the political debate is being dominated by the people whove been wrong about everything up to this point, who said, well, you know, actually, interest rates are lower.', 'they just hit a -- more than a year low just now.but they keep on saying, oh, but its any day now.', 'weve got to be afraid of those people who arent visible in the markets and so on.but this is a -- there is this problem that people have got this austerity notion in their mind, not based on anything thats actually happening, but based upon this hypothetical notion and because it appeals to people who just feel that there has to be some reason to make people suffer even more.amanpour: let me put up this graphic, talking about the gross domestic product of the second quarter.', 'growth is happening, but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted.', 'i see you shaking your head in this debate.', 'the financial times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect.youre shaking your head.will: well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it.', 'its unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, b, starting weak, its getting weaker, for two reasons.first of all, the stimulus is running out.', 'pauls right about this.', 'cash for clunkers has come and gone.', 'the homebuyers tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone.second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls.', 'the trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save.', 'the savings rate is now 6.2 percent.so what you have is what i think keynes called the paradox of thrift.krugman: exactly.will: its a virtue until it isnt a virtue.brazile: well, im not the resident economist on the panel, clearly, but whats happening, christiane, is that were not creating jobs.', 'the economy is -- is -- is not creating enough jobs.', 'unemployment remains high.', 'the democrats will have to campaign on the promise that the policies that theyve put forward thus far has averted the great depression 2.0.and going forward, this is a choice between going back to the past, going back to bush-onomics, or going forward with a path toward economic growth, which brings us back to the bush tax cuts and -- and whether or not the -- the congress will -- will just let them expire in january or let some of them stay on the table.amanpour: well, you heard what i asked speaker pelosi, and she said she hoped that this would come to a resolution before the -- before the midterms.', 'is that likely?brazile: well, i dont think so.', 'i mean, look, congress on the house side, theyre away for six weeks.', 'theyre going out.', 'theyre going to campaign on what theyve accomplished.but i think when they return, theyre going to have to turn back toward the budget, turn toward the economy, and once again convince the voters out there that theyve done something to provide economic growth for the future.krugman: just wanted to say, george, its exactly what i would have done in describing it.', 'the forces for growth are fading out.', 'were not looking good going forward.', 'this is very difficult.', 'its very hard for an administration in power to run on the campaign slogan, it could have been worse, and that is essentially -- and its true.', 'it actually could have been a lot worse, but -- but that doesnt sell very well.amanpour: can i...will: lest it be thought that paul and i agree on something, let me...amanpour: well, you might.', 'maybe this is a rarity today.will: no, this is not the case, because paul thinks the government is dangerously frugal at this point, and i do not think so.', 'i side with people like kenneth rogoff at harvard who say there is time for austerity, and this is it.krugman: well, you know, we can...amanpour: thats happening in europe, as you know...(crosstalk)krugman: thats -- yes, i think ken rogoff is doing some damage here with some pretty bad statistics.', 'but...amanpour: can i -- can i move over to madrid again and ask ahmed about this economy, because it obviously clearly impacts whats happening in -- in americas foreign policy, as well.', 'what do people in pakistan, whove been promised so much aid by the united states -- does this even figure in their debates when they look at the u.s., the fact that the money is shorter?rashid: oh, it does very much.', 'i mean, i think really people are fully aware that the continuation of the american presence in afghanistan and the aid to pakistan is dependent, is hostage, if you like, to whether the american economy picks up or not, especially in the autumn, when the surge will be completed, the troop surge will be completed, a very critical moment will appear when obama has to decide what his next six-months, one-year policy is going to be in the policy review.and all of this probably is going to be dominated by how effective or uneffective the american economy is doing.', 'i mean, weve seen the vote in congress now.', 'i mean, what happens in three months time if the vote in congress is even more lopsided and more democrats turn against the war?amanpour: that is indeed a big question.', 'let us move on, though, right now -- and i want to move on to something else that the democrats made a huge, big deal about when they came in, and that was to have an ethical congress, to have a -- you know, drain the swamp, as many people said.', 'this is what president obama said just in the last couple of days over the travails of representative charlie rangel.', '(begin video clip)obama: i think charlie rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well, but these allegations are very troubling.', 'and, you know, hes somebody whos at the end of his career, 80 years old.', 'im sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity, and my hope is, is that happens.', '(end video clip)brazile: it would be politically expedient for mr. rangel to just step down and resign, but hes not the kind of lawmaker that would do that.', 'these are serious allegations, and mr. rangel would like to have his day up on the hill to defend himself, defend his honor, and answer to some of these charges.again, its easy to drain the swamp if you have some type of drano, but its clogged up, and i think mr. rangel and others would like to have their day to clear their names.amanpour: what about the president making that pretty...krugman: yes, well, they...amanpour: ... dismissive statement?krugman: no, i think its fair enough.', 'but, you know, let me ask -- theres something i dont understand about this whole thing.', 'there are actually two major investigations of members of congress underway right now.', 'theres charlie rangel, whos accused of some fairly petty, although stupid and wrong, ethical violations, and theres senator john ensign, whos facing a criminal investigation and which actually -- its even a story that involves sex.', 'and you get no publicity whatsoever on the ensign investigation.why is rangel getting all this attention?amanpour: is that fair, george?will: well, rangel is much more important, because hes chairman of an important committee.', 'and in fact, rangels misfortune is a national misfortune, because we desperately need -- and after the deficit commission reports in december, we might have had -- serious tax reform in this country.', 'that requires a cooperative member leading that committee in the house.', '(crosstalk)krugman: nothings -- nothings going to happen.', '(end video clip)krugman: if theres actually anything to come out of the deficit commission, it would matter, but its not.will: ... as rostenkowski was with ronald reagans tax reform.', 'now, rangel has a weak position, but a very -- a weak case, but a strong position.', 'his strong position is the president and everyone wants this thing over with so the democrats wont be tarred with this, and therefore he can hold out for some minor reprimand -- indeed, a reprimand, technically -- just to liquidate this and get out of here.krugman: in a way, hes sort of the hamid karzai of the u.s. congress.amanpour: well, i was going to -- we only have 15 seconds left, but i was going to ask ahmed rashid what they make of all of this, given so much corruption charges over there.', 'ahmed, were out of time, but thank you all so much for joining us.and the roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com, where

way.clinton: nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.', 'five million people lost their homes.', 'and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.now, we have come back from that abyss.', 'and it has not been easy.', 'so were now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.independent experts have looked at what ive proposed and looked at what donalds proposed, and basically theyve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.theyve looked at my plans and theyve said, ok, if we can do this, and i intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.', 'take

our leadership in the world.', 'and i think its important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.', 'thats why i said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.trump: but you have no plan.clinton: but in -- oh, but i do.trump: secretary, you have no plan.clinton: in fact, i have written a book about it.', 'its called stronger together.', 'you can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...trump: thats about all youve...(crosstalk)holt: folks, were going to...clinton: ... or at an airport near you.holt: were going to move to...clinton: but its because i see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.', 'we also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.so we have a very robust set of plans.', 'and people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.trump: you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.', 'you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.', 'you are going to drive business out.', 'your regulations are a disaster, and youre going to increase regulations all over the place.and by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan.', 'im very proud of it.', 'it will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.', 'but regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.when i go around -- lester, i tell you this, ive been all over.', 'and when i go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that im cutting regulation.', 'you have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.', 'and you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.im going to cut regulations.', 'im going to cut taxes big league, and youre going to raise taxes big league, end of story.holt: let me get you to pause right there, because were going to move into -- were going to move into the next segment.', 'were going to talk taxes...clinton: that cant -- that cant be left to stand.holt: please just take 30 seconds and then were going to go on.clinton: i kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...trump: facts.clinton: so we have taken the home page of my website, hillaryclinton.com, and weve turned it into a fact-checker.', 'so if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.', 'because what i have proposed...trump: and take a look at mine, also, and youll see.clinton: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.', 'what i have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.', 'what i have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.', 'and i think its time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.holt: well, you just opened the next segment.trump: well, could i just finish -- i think i...(crosstalk)holt: im going to give you a chance right here...trump: i think i should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.holt: ... with a new 15-minute segment...trump: shes going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.holt: mr. trump, im going to...trump: and look at her website.', 'you know what?', 'its no difference than this.', 'shes telling us how to fight isis.', 'just go to her website.', 'she tells you how to fight isis on her website.', 'i dont think general douglas macarthur would like that too much.holt: the next segment, were continuing...clinton: well, at least i have a plan to fight isis.holt: ... achieving prosperity...trump: no, no, youre telling the enemy everything you want to do.clinton: no, were not.', 'no, were not.trump: see, youre telling the enemy everything you want to do.', 'no wonder youve been fighting -- no wonder youve been fighting isis your entire adult life.clinton: thats a -- thats -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.holt: ok, you are unpacking a lot here.', 'and were still on the issue of achieving prosperity.', 'and i want to talk about taxes.', 'the fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.secretary clinton, youre calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest americans.', 'id like you to further defend that.', 'and, mr. trump, youre calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.', 'id like you to defend that.', 'and this next two-minute answer goes to you, mr. trump.trump: well, im really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.', 'theyre going to expand their companies.', 'theyre going to do a tremendous job.im getting rid of the carried interest provision.', 'and if you really look, its not a tax -- its really not a great thing for the wealthy.', 'its a great thing for the middle class.', 'its a great thing for companies to expand.and when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when theyre going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they cant bring the money back, because politicians like secretary clinton wont allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.so what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country, and theyre, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.', 'and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they cant work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.instead of that, theyre leaving our country to get their money, because they cant bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they cant get together.', 'because we have -- we have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something.and heres the thing.', 'republicans and democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.', 'i happen to think its double that.', 'its probably $5 trillion that we cant bring into our country, lester.', 'and with a little leadership, youd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.but we have no leadership.', 'and honestly, that starts with secretary clinton.holt: all right.', 'you have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest americans, secretary clinton.clinton: i have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, im going to be blamed for everything thats ever happened.trump: why not?clinton: why not?', 'yeah, why not?', '(laughter)you know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.', 'now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...trump: theres nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.holt: this is -- this is secretary clintons two minutes, please.trump: yes.clinton: yeah, well, lets start the clock again, lester.', 'weve looked at your tax proposals.', 'i dont see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals youre referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money thats stranded overseas.', 'i happen to support that.trump: then you didnt read it.clinton: i happen to -- i happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.', 'but when i look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.', 'youve proposed an approach that has a...trump: who gave it that name?', 'the first ive -- who gave it that name?', '(crosstalk)holt: mr. trump, this is secretary clintons two minutes.clinton: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.', 'and when you look at what you are proposing...trump: how much?', 'how much for my family?', 'clinton: ... it is...trump: lester, how much?clinton: ... as i said, trumped-up trickle-down.', 'trickle-down did not work.', 'it got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. slashing taxes on the wealthy hasnt worked.and a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.', 'and they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.clinton: i dont think top-down works in america.', 'i think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.', 'those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.', 'broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in america, not more advantages for people at the very top.holt: mr. trump, were...trump: typical politician.', 'all talk, no action.', 'sounds good, doesnt work.', 'never going to happen.', 'our country is suffering because people like secretary clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of whats going on.now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the great depression.', 'and believe me: were in a bubble right now.', 'and the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, thats going to come crashing down.we are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.', 'and we better be awfully careful.', 'and we have a fed thats doing political things.', 'this janet yellen of the fed.', 'the fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.', 'and believe me: the day obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, youre going to see some very bad things happen, because the fed is not doing their job.', 'the fed is being more political than secretary clinton.holt: mr. trump, were talking about the burden that americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.', 'and the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.', 'dont americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?trump: i dont mind releasing -- im under a routine audit.', 'and itll be released.', 'and -- as soon as the audits finished, it will be released.but you will learn more about donald trump by going down to the federal elections, where i filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.', 'it shows income -- in fact, the income -- i just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.', 'if you would have told me i was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, i would have been very surprised.but thats the kind of thinking that our country needs.', 'when we have a country thats doing so badly, thats being ripped off by every single country in the world, its the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.', 'you know what that is?', 'that means, whos negotiating these trade deals?we have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.holt: the irs says an audit...trump: excuse me.holt: ... of your taxes -- youre perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.', 'and so the question, does the publics right to know outweigh your personal...trump: well, i told you, i will release them as soon as the audit.', 'look, ive been under audit almost for 15 years.', 'i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.', 'i said, do you get audited?', 'i get audited almost every year.and in a way, i should be complaining.', 'im not even complaining.', 'i dont mind it.', 'its almost become a way of life.', 'i get audited by the irs.', 'but other people dont.i will say this.', 'we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.', 'i will release my tax returns -- against my lawyers wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.', 'as soon as she releases them, i will release.', '(applause)i will release my tax returns.', 'and thats against -- my lawyers, they say, dont do it.', 'i will tell you this.', 'no -- in fact, watching shows, theyre reading the papers.', 'almost every lawyer says, you dont release your returns until the audits complete.', 'when the audits complete, ill do it.', 'but i would go against them if she releases her e-mails.holt: so its negotiable?trump: its not negotiable, no.', 'let her release the e-mails.', 'why did she delete 33,000...holt: well, ill let her answer that.', 'but let me just admonish the audience one more time.', 'there was an agreement.', 'we did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.', 'secretary clinton?clinton: well, i think youve seen another example of bait-and- switch here.', 'for 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.', 'you can go and see nearly, i think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.', 'we know the irs has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when youre under audit.so youve got to ask yourself, why wont he release his tax returns?', 'and i think there may be a couple of reasons.', 'first, maybe hes not as rich as he says he is.', 'second, maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be.clinton: third, we dont know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to wall street and foreign banks.', 'or maybe he doesnt want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax.trump: that makes me smart.clinton: so if hes paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.', 'and i think probably hes not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that hes trying to hide.and the financial disclosure statements, they dont give you the tax rate.', 'they dont give you all the details that tax returns would.', 'and it just seems to me that this is something that the american people deserve to see.', 'and i have no reason to believe that hes ever going to release his tax returns, because theres something hes hiding.and well guess.', 'well keep guessing at what it might be that hes hiding.', 'but i think the question is, were he ever to get near the white house, what would be those conflicts?', 'who does he owe money to?', 'well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.holt: he also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.', 'do you want to respond to that?clinton: i do.', 'you know, i made a mistake using a private e- mail.', 'trump: thats for sure.clinton: and if i had to do it over again, i would, obviously, do it differently.', 'but im not going to make any excuses.', 'it was a mistake, and i take responsibility for that.holt: mr. trump?trump: that was more than a mistake.', 'that was done purposely.', 'ok?', 'that was not a mistake.', 'that was done purposely.', 'when you have your staff taking the fifth amendment, taking the fifth so theyre not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth, i think its disgraceful.', 'and believe me, this country thinks its -- really thinks its disgraceful, also.as far as my tax returns, you dont learn that much from tax returns.', 'that i can tell you.', 'you learn a lot from financial disclosure.', 'and you should go down and take a look at that.the other thing, im extremely underleveraged.', 'the report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, thats really not a lot of money.', 'its not a lot of money relative to what i had.the buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasnt even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.', 'and the $650 isnt even on that.', 'but its not $650.', 'its much less than that.but i could give you a list of banks, i would -- if that would help you, i would give you a list of banks.', 'these are very fine institutions, very fine banks.', 'i could do that very quickly.i am very underleveraged.', 'i have a great company.', 'i have a tremendous income.', 'and the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way.', 'its because its about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.when we have $20 trillion in debt, and our countrys a mess, you know, its one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape, our airports.', 'our airports are like from a third world country.you land at laguardia, you land at kennedy, you land at lax, you land at newark, and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from china, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- weve become a third world country.so the worst of all things has happened.', 'we owe $20 trillion, and were a mess.', 'we havent even started.', 'and weve spent $6 trillion in the middle east, according to a report that i just saw.', 'whether its 6 or 5, but it looks like its 6, $6 trillion in the middle east, we could have rebuilt our country twice.and its really a shame.', 'and its politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem.', 'our country has tremendous problems.', 'were a debtor nation.', 'were a serious debtor nation.', 'and we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.', 'and we dont have the money, because its been squandered on so many of your ideas.holt: well let you respond and well move on to the next segment.clinton: and maybe because you havent paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.', '(applause)and the other thing i think is important...trump: it would be squandered, too, believe me.clinton: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the united states is your business, then i think we should talk about that.', 'you know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.and, indeed, i have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, donald.', 'ive met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.we have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.', 'its a beautiful facility.', 'it immediately was put to use.', 'and you wouldnt pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...trump: maybe he didnt do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work...clinton: well, to...trump: which our country should do, too.clinton: do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?i can only say that im certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.', 'he provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.and when we talk about your business, youve taken business bankruptcy six times.', 'there are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.', 'you call yourself the king of debt.', 'you talk about leverage.', 'you even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the united states.trump: wrong.', 'wrong.clinton: well, sometimes theres not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.holt: lets let mr. trump...clinton: and we need to be very clear about that.trump: so, yeah, i think -- i do think its time.', 'look, its all words, its all sound bites.', 'i built an unbelievable company.', 'some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the united states, in europe, lots of different places.', 'its an unbelievable company.but on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.', 'and when secretary clinton talks about people that didnt get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.now, if you want to change the laws, youve been there a long time, change the laws.', 'but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because im running a company.', 'my obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.', 'and thats what i do.but what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.', 'ill give you an example.', 'were just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house, so if i dont get there one way, im going to get to pennsylvania avenue another.but were opening the old post office.', 'under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.', 'im a year ahead of schedule.', 'and thats what this country should be doing.we build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost.', 'we buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we dont have people that know what theyre doing.when we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.', 'the trump international is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.', 'and we should be able to do that for our country.holt: well, were well behind schedule, so i want to move to our next segment.', 'we move into our next segment talking about americas direction.', 'and lets start by talking about race.the share of americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest its been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of african-americans by police, as weve seen recently in charlotte and tulsa.', 'race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.so how do you heal the divide?', 'secretary clinton, you get two minutes on this.clinton: well, youre right.', 'race remains a significant challenge in our country.', 'unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system.', 'weve just seen those two tragic examples in both tulsa and charlotte.and weve got to do several things at the same time.', 'we have to restore trust between communities and the police.', 'we have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary.', 'everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.clinton: right now, thats not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.', 'so i have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.', 'ive laid out a platform that i think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.but we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.', 'so we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.', 'and weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.the gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young african- american men, more than the next nine causes put together.', 'so we have to do two things, as i said.', 'we have to restore trust.', 'we have to work with the police.', 'we have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.', 'and we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that were seeing today.holt: all right, mr. trump, you have two minutes.', 'how do you heal the divide?trump: well, first of all, secretary clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words, and thats law and order.', 'and we need law and order.', 'if we dont have it, were not going to have a country.and when i look at whats going on in charlotte, a city i love, a city where i have investments, when i look at whats going on throughout various parts of our country, whether its -- i mean, i can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.i just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the fraternal order of police, we just -- just came in.', 'we have endorsements from, i think, almost every police group, very -- i mean, a large percentage of them in the united states.we have a situation where we have our inner cities, african- americans, hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous.', 'you walk down the street, you get shot.in chicago, theyve had thousands of shootings, thousands since january 1st.', 'thousands of shootings.', 'and im saying, where is this?', 'is this a war-torn country?', 'what are we doing?', 'and we have to stop the violence.', 'we have to bring back law and order.', 'in a place like chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since barack obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in chicago have been killed.', 'we have to bring back law and order.now, whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, mayor giuliani is here, worked very well in new york.', 'it brought the crime rate way down.', 'but you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having it.we have gangs roaming the street.', 'and in many cases, theyre illegally here, illegal immigrants.', 'and they have guns.', 'and they shoot people.', 'and we have to be very strong.', 'and we have to be very vigilant.we have to be -- we have to know what were doing.', 'right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.', 'we have to protect our inner cities, because african-american communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.holt: your two -- your two minutes expired, but i do want to follow up.', 'stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in new york, because it largely singled out black and hispanic young men.trump: no, youre wrong.', 'it went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.', 'it was taken away from her.', 'and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.', 'they would have won an appeal.', 'if you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where its allowed.holt: the argument is that its a form of racial profiling.trump: no, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldnt have them.these are felons.', 'these are people that are bad people that shouldnt be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in chicago from january 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of barack obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.you need more police.', 'you need a better community, you know, relation.', 'you dont have good community relations in chicago.', 'its terrible.', 'i have property there.', 'its terrible whats going on in chicago.but when you look -- and chicagos not the only -- you go to ferguson, you go to so many different places.', 'you need better relationships.', 'i agree with secretary clinton on this.trump: you need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, its not good.but you look at dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.', 'so theres some bad things going on.', 'some really bad things.holt: secretary clinton...trump: but we need -- lester, we need law and order.', 'and we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by whats happening are african-american and hispanic people.', 'and its very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.holt: secretary clinton?clinton: well, ive heard -- ive heard donald say this at his rallies, and its really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.trump: ugh.clinton: you know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.', 'theres a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.but we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.', 'there are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.', 'stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.', 'it did not do what it needed to do.now, i believe in community policing.', 'and, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. property crime is down 40 percent.', 'we just dont want to see it creep back up.', 'weve had 25 years of very good cooperation.but there were some problems, some unintended consequences.', 'too many young african-american and latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.', 'and its just a fact that if youre a young african-american man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.', 'so weve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.', 'we cannot just say law and order.', 'we have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.we need to have more second chance programs.', 'im glad that were ending private prisons in the federal system; i want to see them ended in the state system.', 'you shouldnt have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young americans.', 'so there are some positive ways we can work on this.and i believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.', 'right now -- and this is something donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, weve got too many military- style weapons on the streets.', 'in a lot of places, our police are outgunned.', 'we need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.and we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone whos on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.', 'if youre too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.', 'so there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.holt: secretary clinton, last week, you said weve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.', 'do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?clinton: lester, i think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.', 'i think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.', 'and therefore, i think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am i feeling this way?but when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, i have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.ive met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.', 'they admit its an issue.', 'theyve got a lot of concerns.', 'mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.clinton: they want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.', 'and i think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.holt: mr. trump...trump: id like to respond to that.holt: please.trump: first of all, i agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.', 'i agree with you.', 'when a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and i have the endorsement of the nra, which im very proud of.', 'these are very, very good people, and theyre protecting the second amendment.but i think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.', 'and when people are on there, even if they shouldnt be on there, well help them, well help them legally, well help them get off.', 'but i tend to agree with that quite strongly.i do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.', 'and thats a term that i think was a -- its -- its been horribly met, as you know.', 'i think youve apologized for it.', 'but i think it was a terrible thing to say.and when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, youre talking about takes guns away.', 'well, im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.', 'and i dont think -- i really dont think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.i think maybe theres a political reason why you cant say it, but i really dont believe -- in new york city, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.', 'five hundred murders is a lot of murders.', 'its hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?but we went from 2,200 to 500. and it was continued on by mayor bloomberg.', 'and it was terminated by current mayor.', 'but stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city.', 'tremendous beyond belief.', 'so when you say it has no impact, it really did.', 'it had a very, very big impact.clinton: well, its also fair to say, if were going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.', 'so there is...trump: no, youre wrong.', 'youre wrong.clinton: no, im not.trump: murders are up.', 'all right.', 'you check it.clinton: new york -- new york has done an excellent job.', 'and i give credit -- i give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.', 'and other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.look, one murder is too many.', 'but it is important that we learn about what has been effective.', 'and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.', 'who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?but lets also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.', 'and so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.holt: this conversation is about race.', 'and so, mr. trump, i have to ask you for five...trump: id like to just respond, if i might.holt: please -- 20 seconds.trump: id just like to respond.holt: please respond, then ive got a quick follow-up for you.trump: i will.', 'look, the african-american community has been let down by our politicians.', 'they talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, ill see you in four years.the african-american community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.', 'theyve been abused and used in order to get votes by democrat politicians, because thats what it is.', 'theyve controlled these communities for up to 100 years.holt: mr. trump, let me...(crosstalk)clinton: well, i -- i do think...trump: and i will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and i just left detroit, and i just left philadelphia, and i just -- you know, youve seen me, ive been all over the place.', 'you decided to stay home, and thats ok. but i will tell you, ive been all over.', 'and ive met some of the greatest people ill ever meet within these communities.', 'and they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.holt: mr. trump, i...clinton: i think -- i think -- i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.', 'and, yes, i did.', 'and you know what else i prepared for?', 'i prepared to be president.', 'and i think thats a good thing.', '(applause)holt: mr. trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nations first black president was not a natural-born citizen.', 'you questioned his legitimacy.', 'in the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most americans have accepted for years: the president was born in the united states.', 'can you tell us what took you so long?trump: ill tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.', 'sidney blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of secretary clinton.', 'and her campaign manager, patti doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against president obama, fought very hard.', 'and you can go look it up, and you can check it out.trump: and if you look at cnn this past week, patti solis doyle was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened.', 'blumenthal sent mcclatchy, highly respected reporter at mcclatchy, to kenya to find out about it.', 'they were pressing it very hard.', 'she failed to get the birth certificate.when i got involved, i didnt fail.', 'i got him to give the birth certificate.', 'so im satisfied with it.', 'and ill tell you why im satisfied with it.holt: that was...(crosstalk)trump: because i want to get on to defeating isis, because i want to get on to creating jobs, because i want to get on to having a strong border, because i want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.holt: i will let you respond.', 'its important.', 'but i just want to get the answer here.', 'the birth certificate was produced in 2011. youve continued to tell the story and question the presidents legitimacy in 2012, 13, 14, 15...trump: yeah.holt: .... as recently as january.', 'so the question is, what changed your mind?trump: well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.', 'i figured youd ask the question tonight, of course.', 'but nobody was caring much about it.', 'but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.', 'and i think i did a good job.secretary clinton also fought it.', 'i mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, thats not true.', 'look, its true.', 'sidney blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at cnn, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.', 'and she was involved.', 'but just like she cant bring back jobs, she cant produce.holt: im sorry.', 'im just going to follow up -- and i will let you respond to that, because theres a lot there.', 'but were talking about racial healing in this segment.', 'what do you say to americans, people of color who...(crosstalk)trump: well, it was very -- i say nothing.', 'i say nothing, because i was able to get him to produce it.', 'he should have produced it a long time before.', 'i say nothing.but let me just tell you.', 'when you talk about healing, i think that ive developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the african-american community.', 'i think you can see that.and i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.', 'and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.holt: secretary clinton?clinton: well, just listen to what you heard.', '(laughter)and clearly, as donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and lester holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.but it cant be dismissed that easily.', 'he has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an american citizen.', 'there was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.but, remember, donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the justice department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to african-americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.', 'he actually was sued twice by the justice department.so he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.', 'and the birther lie was a very hurtful one.', 'you know, barack obama is a man of great dignity.', 'and i could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.but i like to remember what michelle obama said in her amazing speech at our democratic national convention: when they go low, we go high.', 'and barack obama went high, despite donald trumps best efforts to bring him down.holt: mr. trump, you can respond and were going to move on to the next segment.trump: i would love to respond.', 'first of all, i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama.', 'you treated him with terrible disrespect.', 'and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.', 'it doesnt work that way.', 'you were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.', 'i dont think you can deny that.but just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.', 'so when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesnt work.', 'it really doesnt.now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when i was very young, i went into my fathers company, had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.', 'we settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.', 'it was very easy to do.trump: i notice you bring that up a lot.', 'and, you know, i also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which i dont do on you.', 'maybe im trying to save the money.but, frankly, i look -- i look at that, and i say, isnt that amazing?', 'because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and its just one of those things.ill go one step further.', 'in palm beach, florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, i opened a club, and really got great credit for it.', 'no discrimination against african- americans, against muslims, against anybody.', 'and its a tremendously successful club.', 'and im so glad i did it.', 'and i have been given great credit for what i did.', 'and im very, very proud of it.', 'and thats the way i feel.', 'that is the true way i feel.holt: our next segment is called securing america.', 'we want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.', 'our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.', 'so my question is, whos behind it?', 'and how do we fight it?secretary clinton, this answer goes to you.clinton: well, i think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly were facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.', 'there are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.but increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.', 'the most recent and troubling of these has been russia.', 'theres no doubt now that russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and i am deeply concerned about this.', 'i know donalds very praiseworthy of vladimir putin, but putin is playing a really...(crosstalk)clinton: ... tough, long game here.', 'and one of the things hes done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the democratic national committee.', 'and we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.', 'we need to make it very clear -- whether its russia, china, iran or anybody else -- the united states has much greater capacity.', 'and we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.and were going to have to make it clear that we dont want to use the kinds of tools that we have.', 'we dont want to engage in a different kind of warfare.', 'but we will defend the citizens of this country.and the russians need to understand that.', 'i think theyve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.', 'and thats why i was so -- i was so shocked when donald publicly invited putin to hack into americans.', 'that is just unacceptable.', 'its one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in republican information -- in administrations...holt: your two minutes have expired.clinton: ... have said that donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.', 'its comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.holt: mr. trump, you have two minutes and the same question.', 'whos behind it?', 'and how do we fight it?trump: i do want to say that i was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.', 'that just happened, and many more are coming.', 'and im very proud of it.in addition, i was just endorsed by ice.', 'theyve never endorsed anybody before on immigration.', 'i was just endorsed by ice.', 'i was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 border patrol agents.so when secretary clinton talks about this, i mean, ill take the admirals and ill take the generals any day over the political hacks that i see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.', 'ok?', 'because look at the mess that were in.', 'look at the mess that were in.as far as the cyber, i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said.', 'we should be better than anybody else, and perhaps were not.', 'i dont think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc.', 'shes saying russia, russia, russia, but i dont -- maybe it was.', 'i mean, it could be russia, but it could also be china.', 'it could also be lots of other people.', 'it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, ok?trump: you dont know who broke in to dnc.but what did we learn with dnc?', 'we learned that bernie sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by debbie wasserman schultz.', 'look what happened to her.', 'but bernie sanders was taken advantage of.', 'thats what we learned.now, whether that was russia, whether that was china, whether it was another country, we dont know, because the truth is, under president obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over.we came in with the internet, we came up with the internet, and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what isis is doing with the internet, theyre beating us at our own game.', 'isis.so we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.', 'it is -- it is a huge problem.', 'i have a son.', 'hes 10 years old.', 'he has computers.', 'he is so good with these computers, its unbelievable.', 'the security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.', 'and maybe its hardly doable.but i will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.', 'but thats true throughout our whole governmental society.', 'we have so many things that we have to do better, lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.holt: secretary clinton?clinton: well, i think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.', 'i have put forth a plan to defeat isis.', 'it does involve going after them online.', 'i think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent isis and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and europe and elsewhere.but we also have to intensify our air strikes against isis and eventually support our arab and kurdish partners to be able to actually take out isis in raqqa, end their claim of being a caliphate.were making progress.', 'our military is assisting in iraq.', 'and were hoping that within the year well be able to push isis out of iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in syria.but we have to be cognizant of the fact that theyve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.and i would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.', 'i was involved in a number of efforts to take out al qaida leadership when i was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin laden.', 'and i think we need to go after baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.', 'because weve got to defeat isis, and weve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.holt: you mention isis, and we think of isis certainly as over there, but there are american citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on american soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in new york and new jersey, the knife attack at a mall in minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in san bernardino and orlando.', 'ill ask this to both of you.', 'tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by american citizens, mr. trump?trump: well, first i have to say one thing, very important.', 'secretary clinton is talking about taking out isis.', 'we will take out isis.', 'well, president obama and secretary clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldnt have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.', 'and isis was formed.so she talks about taking them out.', 'shes been doing it a long time.', 'shes been trying to take them out for a long time.', 'but they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.', 'and then you wouldnt have had them.or, as ive been saying for a long time, and i think youll agree, because i said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- isis would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.', 'and now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in libya, which was another one of her disasters.holt: secretary clinton?clinton: well, i hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.', 'donald supported the invasion of iraq.trump: wrong.clinton: that is absolutely proved over and over again.trump: wrong.', 'wrong.clinton: he actually advocated for the actions we took in libya and urged that gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.clinton: but the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is george w. bush made the agreement about when american troops would leave iraq, not barack obama.and the only way that american troops could have stayed in iraq is to get an agreement from the then-iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the iraqi government would not give that.but lets talk about the question you asked, lester.', 'the question you asked is, what do we do here in the united states?', 'thats the most important part of this.', 'how do we prevent attacks?', 'how do we protect our people?and i think weve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.', 'i was so proud of law enforcement in new york, in minnesota, in new jersey.', 'you know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by rahami.', 'and they brought him down.', 'and we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.so weve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from europe, from the middle east.', 'that means weve got to work more closely with our allies, and thats something that donald has been very dismissive of.were working with nato, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.', 'were working with our friends in the middle east, many of which, as you know, are muslim majority nations.', 'donald has consistently insulted muslims abroad, muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with muslim nations and with the american muslim community.theyre on the front lines.', 'they can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.', 'they need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of donalds rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.holt: mr. trump...trump: well, i have to respond.holt: please respond.trump: the secretary said very strongly about working with -- weve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyones ever seen.', 'you look at the middle east, its a total mess.', 'under your direction, to a large extent.but you look at the middle east, you started the iran deal, thats another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, i mean, they were doing so badly.', 'they were choking on the sanctions.', 'and now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyre going.but when you look at nato, i was asked on a major show, what do you think of nato?', 'and you have to understand, im a businessperson.', 'i did really well.', 'but i have common sense.', 'and i said, well, ill tell you.', 'i havent given lots of thought to nato.', 'but two things.number one, the 28 countries of nato, many of them arent paying their fair share.', 'number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- were defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.and, number two, i said, and very strongly, nato could be obsolete, because -- and i was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times, which is unusual for the new york times, to be honest -- but i said, they do not focus on terror.', 'and i was very strong.', 'and i said it numerous times.and about four months ago, i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division.', 'and i think thats great.', 'and i think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of nato.', 'its a lot of money to protect other people.', 'but im all for nato.', 'but i said they have to focus on terror, also.and theyre going to do that.', 'and that was -- believe me -- im sure im not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato.i think we have to get nato to go into the middle east with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of isis, and we have to do it fast, when isis formed in this vacuum created by barack obama and secretary clinton.', 'and believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.', 'not only that, you named the day.', 'they couldnt believe it.', 'they sat back probably and said, i cant believe it.', 'they said...clinton: lester, weve covered...trump: no, wait a minute.clinton: weve covered this ground.trump: when they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.', 'it should have never happened.', 'now, youre talking about taking out isis.', 'but you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.', 'now its in over 30 countries.', 'and youre going to stop them?', 'i dont think so.holt: mr. trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.', 'you had supported the war in iraq before the invasion.', 'what makes your...trump: i did not support the war in iraq.holt: in 2002...trump: that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.holt: my question is, since you supported it...trump: just -- would you like to hear...holt: ... why is your -- why is your judgment...trump: wait a minute.', 'i was against the war in iraq.', 'just so you put it out.holt: the record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...trump: the record does not show that.holt: why was -- is your judgment any...trump: the record shows that im right.', 'when i did an interview with howard stern, very lightly, first time anyones asked me that, i said, very lightly, i dont know, maybe, who knows?', 'essentially.', 'i then did an interview with neil cavuto.', 'we talked about the economy is more important.', 'i then spoke to sean hannity, which everybody refuses to call sean hannity.', 'i had numerous conversations with sean hannity at fox.', 'and sean hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and i spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.holt: why is your judgment better than...trump: and when he -- excuse me.', 'and that was before the war started.', 'sean hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- hes willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.', 'i was against the war.', 'he said, you used to have fights with me, because sean was in favor of the war.and i understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.', 'but nobody called sean hannity.', 'and then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.', 'i think in 04. but they did an article which had me totally against the war in iraq.and one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, theres no doubt.', 'but if somebody -- and ill ask the press -- if somebody would call up sean hannity, this was before the war started.', 'he and i used to have arguments about the war.', 'i said, its a terrible and a stupid thing.', 'its going to destabilize the middle east.', 'and thats exactly what its done.', 'its been a disaster.holt: my reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...trump: no, no.', 'you didnt hear what i said.holt: why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than mrs. clintons judgment?trump: well, i have much better judgment than she does.', 'theres no question about that.', 'i also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?', '(laughter)i have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get madison avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, lets go after -- i think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.', 'i have a winning temperament.', 'i know how to win.', 'she does not have a...holt: secretary clinton?trump: wait.', 'the afl-cio the other day, behind the blue screen, i dont know who you were talking to, secretary clinton, but you were totally out of control.', 'i said, theres a person with a temperament thats got a problem.holt: secretary clinton?clinton: whew, ok.(laughter)lets talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by donald, first, nato.', 'you know, nato as a military alliance has something called article 5, and basically it says this: an attack on one is an attack on all.', 'and you know the only time its ever been invoked?', 'after 9/11, when the 28 nations of nato said that they would go to afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.with respect to iran, when i became secretary of state, iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.', 'they had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the bush administration.', 'they had built covert facilities.', 'they had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.and we had sanctioned them.', 'i voted for every sanction against iran when i was in the senate, but it wasnt enough.', 'so i spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included russia and china to impose the toughest sanctions on iran.and we did drive them to the negotiating table.', 'and my successor, john kerry, and president obama got a deal that put a lid on irans nuclear program without firing a single shot.', 'thats diplomacy.', 'thats coalition-building.', 'thats working with other nations.the other day, i saw donald saying that there were some iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of iran, and they were taunting american sailors who were on a nearby ship.', 'he said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, id blow them out of the water and start another war.', 'thats not good judgment.trump: that would not start a war.clinton: that is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.', 'and the worst part...trump: no, they were taunting us.clinton: ... of what we heard donald say has been about nuclear weapons.', 'he has said repeatedly that he didnt care if other nations got nuclear weapons, japan, south korea, even saudi arabia.', 'it has been the policy of the united states, democrats and republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.', 'he even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in east asia, well, you know, thats fine...trump: wrong.clinton: ... have a good time, folks.trump: its lies.clinton: and, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.', 'that is the number-one threat we face in the world.', 'and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.', 'so a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as i think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.trump: that lines getting a little bit old, i must say.', 'i would like to...clinton: its a good one, though.', 'it well describes the problem.', '(laughter)trump: its not an accurate one at all.', 'its not an accurate one.', 'so i just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.', 'i agree with her on one thing.', 'the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.nuclear is the single greatest threat.', 'just to go down the list, we defend japan, we defend germany, we defend south korea, we defend saudi arabia, we defend countries.', 'they do not pay us.', 'but they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune.', 'thats why were losing -- were losing -- we lose on everything.', 'i say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.', 'all i said, that its very possible that if they dont pay a fair share, because this isnt 40 years ago where we could do what were doing.', 'we cant defend japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...holt: we need to move on.trump: well, wait, but its very important.', 'all i said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.', 'were a country that owes $20 trillion.', 'they have to help us out.holt: our last...trump: as far as the nuclear is concerned, i agree.', 'it is the single greatest threat that this country has.holt: which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing america.', 'on nuclear weapons, president obama reportedly considered changing the nations longstanding policy on first use.', 'do you support the current policy?', 'mr. trump, you have two minutes on that.trump: well, i have to say that, you know, for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia, shes very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.', 'but russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.', 'we have not been updating from the new standpoint.i looked the other night.', 'i was seeing b-52s, theyre old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.', 'we are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.', 'i would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.', 'but i would certainly not do first strike.i think that once the nuclear alternative happens, its over.', 'at the same time, we have to be prepared.', 'i cant take anything off the table.', 'because you look at some of these countries, you look at north korea, were doing nothing there.', 'china should solve that problem for us.', 'china should go into north korea.', 'china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea.and by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal i think ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the iran deal.', 'iran is one of their biggest trading partners.', 'iran has power over north korea.and when they made that horrible deal with iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to north korea.', 'and they should have done something with respect to yemen and all these other places.and when asked to secretary kerry, why didnt you do that?', 'why didnt you add other things into the deal?', 'one of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in

a senior management position for the hollywood pedophile cult nxivm.', 'as second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “as alleged in the indictment, allison mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by keith raniere.', 'the victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” u.s. attorney richard p. donoghue said in a statement.the cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former dynasty actress catherine oxenberg became a member.', 'oxenberg told the new york times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter india was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“some people have said this is a voluntary sorority.', 'the women i have spoken to tell a far different story,” oxenberg said.', '“coercion is not voluntary.', 'extortion is not voluntary.', 'blackmail is not voluntary.”when these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress sarah edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia,

with raniere when they were young girls.', 'one of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview.', 'her death was ruled a suicide.the u.s.

mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against raniere and mack is sex trafficking of children.a quick search for allison mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children.', 'most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children.', 'exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance.', 'the organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members.', 'but the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of seagram heiresses, sara and clare bronfman.their involvement with raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press.', 'the bronfman family has very close ties to the rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, bronfman & rothschild.additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including nancy salzman and the bronfman sisters, are members of bill clinton’s foundation, the clinton global initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.now that raniere is in jail and mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, clare bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.in response to the recent controversy surrounding nxivm, bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against raniere.', 'she praised raniere and the nxivm programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.frank parlato,

the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.', 'and he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the united states army for the failure of the landings at normandy.', 'somehow weve lost that accountability.', 'ive been heavily criticized because i called for the resignation of the chairman of the securities and exchange commission.', 'weve got to start also holding people accountable, and weve got to reward people who succeed.', 'but somehow in washington today -- and im afraid on wall street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.', 'as president of the united states, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.', 'and i promise you that that will happen.lehrer: do you have something directly to say, senator obama, to senator mccain about what he just said?obama: well, i think senator mccains absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when theres a crisis.', 'i mean, weve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been whats good for wall street, but not whats good for main street.', 'and there are folks out there whove been struggling before this crisis took place.', 'and thats why its so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, john said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.lehrer: say it directly to him.obama: i do not think that they are.lehrer: say it directly to him.obama: well, the -- john, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.', 'and...mccain: are you afraid i couldnt hear him?', '(laughter)lehrer: im just determined to get you all to talk to each other.', 'im going to try.obama: the -- and i just fundamentally disagree.', 'and unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when theres a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, theyve got a little financial crisis going on.', 'theyre having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.', 'we havent been paying attention to them.', 'and if you look at our tax policies, its a classic example.lehrer: so, senator mccain, do you agree with what senator obama just said?', 'and, if you dont, tell him what you disagree with.mccain: no, i -- look, weve got to fix the system.', 'weve got fundamental problems in the system.', 'and main street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in washington, d.c., and in the wall street.', 'so theres no doubt that we have a long way to go.', 'and, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that werent doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.', 'but i have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the american worker.', 'and the american worker is the most productive, the most innovative.', 'america is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.', 'but weve got to get through these times, but i have a fundamental belief in the united states of america.', 'and i still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.lehrer: all right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject.', 'and you get two minutes to begin with, senator mccain.', 'and using your word fundamental, are there fundamental differences between your approach and senator obamas approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?mccain: well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in washington.', 'its completely out of control.', 'its gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the great society.', 'we republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.', 'and the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, tom coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway.', 'its a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.', 'and we have former members of congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.', 'you know, we spent $3 million to study the dna of bears in montana.', 'i dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money.', 'and it has got to be brought under control.', 'as president of the united states, i want to assure you, ive got a pen.', 'this ones kind of old.', 'ive got a pen, and im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk.', 'i will make them famous.', 'you will know their names.', 'now, senator obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.', 'he has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that hes been in the united states senate.', 'i suggest that people go up on the web site of citizens against government waste, and theyll look at those projects.', 'that kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in washington, d.c. thats one of the fundamental differences that senator obama and i have.lehrer: senator obama, two minutes.obama: well, senator mccain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why i suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.', 'and hes also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasnt the case with me.', 'but lets be clear: earmarks account for $18 billion in last years budget.', 'senator mccain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.', 'now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.', 'and in his tax plan, you would have ceos of fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million americans out.', 'so my attitude is, weve got to grow the economy from the bottom up.', 'what ive called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.', 'and that means that the ordinary american out there whos collecting a paycheck every day, theyve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.', 'and over time, that, i think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of president bush that john mccain wants to -- wants to follow.lehrer: senator mccain?mccain: well, again, i dont mean to go back and forth, but he... (crosstalk)lehrer: no, thats fine.mccain: senator obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the united states.', 'he didnt happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the united states senate, $932 million in requests.', 'maybe to senator obama its not a lot of money.', 'but the point is that -- you see, i hear this all the time.', 'its only $18 billion.', 'do you know that its tripled in the last five years?', 'do you know that its gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?', 'it corrupts people.', 'thats why we have, as i said, people under federal indictment and charges.', 'its a system thats got to be cleaned up.', 'i have fought against it my career.', 'i have fought against it.', 'i was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the appropriations committee.', 'i didnt win miss congeniality in the united states senate.', 'now, senator obama didnt mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.', 'now, thats a fundamental difference between myself and senator obama.', 'i want to cut spending.', 'i want to keep taxes low.', 'the worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise peoples taxes.obama: i -- i dont know where john is getting his figures.', 'lets just be clear.', 'what i do is i close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states.', 'i make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.', 'i think those are pretty important priorities.', 'and i pay for every dime of it.', 'but lets go back to the original point.', 'john, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.', 'and, absolutely, we need earmark reform.', 'and when im president, i will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.', 'but the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how were going to get the middle class back on track.obama: and when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, i think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we cant afford another four.lehrer: respond directly to him about that, to senator obama about that, about the -- hes made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts.mccain: well -- well, let me give you an example of what senator obama finds objectionable, the business tax.', 'right now, the united states of american business (ootc:arbu) pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.', 'ireland pays 11 percent.', 'now, if youre a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where its 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, youre going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.', 'i want to cut that business tax.', 'i want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the united states of america and create jobs.', 'but, again, i want to return.', 'its a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.', 'i can tell you, its rife.', 'its throughout.', 'the united states senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.', 'look at them.', 'youll be appalled.', 'and senator obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.', 'so the point is, i want people to have tax cuts.', 'i want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.', 'i want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in america.', 'i know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in senator obamas definition of rich.lehrer: senator obama, you have a question for senator mccain on that?', 'obama: well, let me just make a couple of points.lehrer: all right.obama: my definition -- heres what i can tell the american people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.', 'and if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase.', 'now, john mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right.', 'heres the problem: there are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of senator mccain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.', 'and what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.', 'its not like you want to close the loopholes.', 'you just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.', 'and thats a problem.', 'just one last point i want to make, since senator mccain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.', 'now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.', 'so you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.', 'heres the only problem: your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer.', 'and if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.', 'it is not a good deal for the american people.', 'but its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be.mccain: well, you know, let me just...lehrer: weve got to go to another lead question.mccain: i know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.', 'we had an energy bill before the united states senate.', 'it was festooned with christmas tree ornaments.', 'it had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, i mean, billions of dollars worth.', 'i voted against it; senator obama voted for it.obama: john, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.mccain: youve got to look at our record.', 'youve got to look at our records.', 'thats the important thing.', 'who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?', 'who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?', 'whos the person who has believed that the best thing for america is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?', 'and ive fought to simplify it, and i have proposals to simplify it.', 'lets give every american a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.', 'and so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.', 'but, again, senator obama has shifted on a number of occasions.', 'he has voted in the united states senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.obama: thats not true, john.', 'thats not true.mccain: and thats just a fact.', 'again, you can look it up.obama: look, its just not true.', 'and if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, john -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.', 'now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.', 'but heres the problem: if we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.', 'and...mccain: with all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.obama: no, but, john, the fact of the matter is, is that i was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.', 'weve got an emergency bill on the senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but youre opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.lehrer: all right.', 'all right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about.', 'and what -- and the first answer is to you, senator obama.', 'as president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is its going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the united states, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?obama: well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.', 'we dont yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.', 'the economy is slowing down, so its hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.', 'but theres no doubt that were not going to be able to do everything that i think needs to be done.', 'there are some things that i think have to be done.', 'we have to have energy independence, so ive put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on middle eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy (ootc:aegc) , solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that were developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the united states, in ohio and michigan, instead of japan and south korea.', 'we have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.', 'just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on american families.', 'they are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.', 'im meeting folks all over the country.', 'we have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.', 'the third thing we have to do is weve got to make sure that were competing in education.', 'weve got to invest in science and technology.', 'china had a space launch and a space walk.', 'weve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.', 'and one of the things i think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in america.', 'and i also think that were going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.', 'also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.', 'so there are some -- some things that weve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.', 'we cant shortchange those things.', 'weve got to eliminate programs that dont work, and weve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.lehrer: are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, senator mccain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?mccain: look, we, no matter what, weve got to cut spending.', 'we have -- as i said, weve let government get completely out of control.', 'senator obama has the most liberal voting record in the united states senate.', 'its hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.', 'the point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.', 'first of all, by the way, id eliminate ethanol subsidies.', 'i oppose ethanol subsidies.', 'i think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.', 'we now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.', 'we tried to build a little ship called the littoral combat ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still havent done it.', 'so we need to have fixed-cost contracts.', 'we need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.', 'i know how to do that.mccain: i saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between boeing and dod that was completely wrong.', 'and we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so i know how to do this because ive been involved these issues for many, many years.', 'but i think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that arent and eliminate them and well have to scrub every agency of government.lehrer: but if i hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout?', 'is that what youre saying?obama: no.', 'as i said before, jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...lehrer: like what?obama: ... deferred and delayed.', 'well, look, i want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.', 'that is a big project.', 'that is a multi-year project.lehrer: not willing to give that up?obama: not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we cant do.', 'but john is right we have to make cuts.', 'we right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the medicare system.', 'doesnt work any better through the private insurers.', 'they just skim off $15 billion.', 'that was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how medicare works.', 'they did it on the medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.', 'tom -- or john mentioned me being wildly liberal.', 'mostly thats just me opposing george bushs wrong headed policies since ive been in congress but i think it is that it is also important to recognize i work with tom coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative republicans who john already mentioned to set up what we call a google for government saying well list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that johns been railing about.lehrer: what im trying to get at this is this.', 'excuse me if i may, senator.', 'trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the united states come january.', 'at the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved.', 'and what im trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.mccain: how about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.lehrer: spending freeze?mccain: i think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions the caring of veterans national defense and several other vital issues.lehrer: would you go for that?obama: the problem with a spending freeze is youre using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.', 'there are some programs that are very important that are under funded.', 'i went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this medicare subsidy doesnt make sense.', 'let me tell you another place to look for some savings.', 'we are currently spending $10 billion a month in iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.', 'it seems to me that if were going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.mccain: look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that dont like us very much.', 'some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.', 'we have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.', 'senator obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.', 'you cant get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but its also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned and the issue i have been involved in for many, many years and im proud of the work of the work that ive done there along with president clinton.lehrer: before we go to another lead question.', 'let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here.', 'are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the united states beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- i mean, is it a major move?', 'is it going to have a major affect?obama: theres no doubt it will affect our budgets.', 'there is no doubt about it.', 'not only -- even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, we holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the great depression when roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.', 'if were lucky and do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.', 'and because of the economys slowing down, i think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president im go doing have to make some tough decision.', 'the only point i want to make is this, that in order to make the tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and our priorities and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then i think we have made a bad decision and i want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities.mccain: well, i want to make sure were not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with senator obamas health care plan.', 'i want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.', 'not the federal government.', 'look.', 'we have to obviously cut spending.', 'i have fought to cut spending.', 'senator obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.', 'i would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.', 'we cant i think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but i also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.', 'and spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.', 'and the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.', 'we owe china $500 billion.', 'and spending, i know, can be brought under control because i have fought against excessive spending my entire career.', 'and i got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in washington.obama: i just want to make this point, jim.', 'john, its been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.', 'this orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.', 'so to stand here and after eight years and say that youre going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasnt happened i think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.lehrer: quick response to senator obama.mccain: its well-known that i have not been elected miss congeniality in the united states senate nor with the administration.', 'i have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on guantanamo bay.', 'on a -- on the way that the iraq war was conducted.', 'i have a long record and the american people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the senate and im happy to say that ive got a partner thats a good maverick along with me now.lehrer: all right.', 'lets go another subject.', 'lead question, two minutes to you, senator mccain.', 'much has been said about the lessons of vietnam.', 'what do you see as the lessons of iraq?mccain: i think the lessons of iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.', 'our initial military success, we went in to baghdad and everybody celebrated.', 'and then the war was very badly mishandled.', 'i went to iraq in 2003 and came back and said, weve got to change this strategy.', 'this strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and i fought for it.', 'and finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.', 'this strategy has succeeded.', 'and we are winning in iraq.', 'and we will come home with victory and with honor.', 'and that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.mccain: and i want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.', 'the consequences of defeat would have been increased iranian influence.', 'it would have been increase in sectarian violence.', 'it would have been a wider war, which the united states of america might have had to come back.', 'so there was a lot at stake there.', 'and thanks to this great general, david petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.', 'and we are winning in iraq, and we will come home.', 'and we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.lehrer: two minutes, how you see the lessons of iraq, senator obama.obama: well, this is an area where senator mccain and i have a fundamental difference because i think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.', 'now six years ago, i stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because i said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadnt finished the job in afghanistan.', 'we hadnt caught bin laden.', 'we hadnt put al qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, i thought that it was going to be a distraction.', 'now senator mccain and president bush had a very different judgment.', 'and i wish i had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but thats not the case.', 'weve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.', 'we have lost over 4,000 lives.', 'we have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. we took our eye off the ball.', 'and not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.', 'so i think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and i will not, as president, in order to keep the american people safe.', 'but we have to use our military wisely.', 'and we did not use our military wisely in iraq.lehrer: do you agree with that, the lesson of iraq?mccain: the next president of the united states is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into iraq or not.', 'the next president of the united states is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.', 'thats the decision of the next president of the united states.', 'senator obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.', 'recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.', 'but yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.', 'incredibly, incredibly senator obama didnt go to iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with general petraeus.lehrer: well, lets go at some of these things...mccain: senator obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights nato thats in afghanistan.', 'to this day, he has never had a hearing.lehrer: what about that point?mccain: i mean, its remarkable.lehrer: all right.', 'what about that point?obama: which point?', 'he raised a whole bunch of them.lehrer: i know, ok, lets go to the latter point and well back up.', 'the point about your not having been...obama: look, im very proud of my vice presidential selection, joe biden, who is the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, and as he explains, and as john well knows, the issues of afghanistan, the issues of iraq, critical issues like that, dont go through my subcommittee because theyre done as a committee as a whole.', 'but thats senate inside baseball.', 'but lets get back to the core issue here.', 'senator mccain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.', 'they have done a brilliant job, and general petraeus has done a brilliant job.', 'but understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.', 'and so john likes -- john, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. you talk about the surge.', 'the war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.', 'you said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.', 'you were wrong.', 'you said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.', 'you were wrong.', 'you said that there was no history of violence between shia and sunni.', 'and you were wrong.', 'and so my question is... (crosstalk)lehrer: senator obama...obama: ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then i think we can take a look at our judgment.lehrer: i have got a lot on the plate here...mccain: im afraid senator obama doesnt understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.', 'but the important -- id like to tell you, two fourths of july ago i was in baghdad.', 'general petraeus invited senator lindsey graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for iraqi freedom and american freedom.', 'i was honored to be there.', 'i was honored to speak to those troops.', 'and you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.', 'and you know what they said to us?', 'they said, let us win.', 'they said, let us win.', 'we dont want our kids coming back here.', 'and this strategy, and this general, they are winning.', 'senator obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in iraq.obama: thats not true.mccain: they just passed an electoral...obama: thats not true.mccain: an election law just in the last few days.', 'there is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.', 'they inform on the bad guys.', 'and peace comes to the country, and prosperity.', 'thats whats happening in iraq, and it wasnt a tactic.lehrer: let me see...obama: jim, jim, this is a big...mccain: it was a stratagem.', 'and that same strategy will be employed in afghanistan by this great general.', 'and senator obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in iraq and afghanistan.obama: jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.', 'first of all, lets talk about this troop funding issue because john always brings this up.', 'senator mccain cut -- senator mccain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didnt believe in a timetable.', 'i opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to george bush.', 'we had a difference on the timetable.', 'we didnt have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.', 'we had a legitimate difference, and i absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.', 'and the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.', 'the question is, was this wise?', 'we have seen afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.', 'we need more troops there.', 'we need more resources there.', 'senator mccain, in the rush to go into iraq, said, you know what?', 'weve been successful in afghanistan.', 'there is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.', 'this is a time when bin laden was still out, and now theyve reconstituted themselves.', 'secretary of defense robert gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in afghanistan and it needs to end there.', 'but we cant do it if we are not willing to give iraq back its country.', 'now, what ive said is we should end this war responsibly.', 'we should do it in phases.', 'but in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin laden and crush al qaeda.', 'and right now, the commanders in afghanistan, as well as admiral mullen, have acknowledged that we dont have enough troops to deal with afghanistan because we still have more troops in iraq than we did before the surge.mccain: admiral mullen suggests that senator obamas plan is dangerous for america.obama: thats not the case.mccain: thats what ...obama: what he said was a precipitous...mccain: thats what admiral mullen said.obama: ... withdrawal would be dangerous.', 'he did not say that.', 'thats not true.mccain: and also general petraeus said the same thing.', 'osama bin laden and general petraeus have one thing in common that i know of, they both said that iraq is the central battleground.', 'now general petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, senator obamas original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.', 'and im -- im -- understand why senator obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.mccain: it didnt exceed beyond mine, because i know that thats a strategy that has worked and can succeed.', 'but if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt senator obamas plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in afghanistan.lehrer: afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question.', 'now, having resolved iraq, well move to afghanistan.', '(laughter) and it goes to you, senator obama, and its a -- it picks up on a point thats already been made.', 'do you think more troops -- more u.s. troops should be sent to afghanistan, how many, and when?obama: yes, i think we need more troops.', 'ive been saying that for over a year now.', 'and i think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because its been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.', 'we had the highest fatalities among u.s. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. and we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- al qaida and taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.', 'they are feeling emboldened.', 'and we cannot separate afghanistan from iraq, because what our commanders have said is we dont have the troops right now to deal with afghanistan.', 'so i would send two to three additional brigades to afghanistan.', 'now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no al qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in afghanistan.', 'and that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that al qaida is the greatest threat against the united states and that secretary of defense gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in afghanistan and in pakistan.', 'so heres what we have to do comprehensively, though.', 'its not just more troops.', 'we have to press the afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.', 'and ive said this to president karzai.', 'number two, weve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.', 'number three, weve got to deal with pakistan, because al qaida and the taliban have safe havens in pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under george bush, with the support of senator mccain, weve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.', 'and until we do, americans here at home are not going to be safe.lehrer: afghanistan, senator mccain?mccain: first of all, i wont repeat the mistake that i regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the afghan freedom fighters and drive the russians out of afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.', 'and the result over time was the taliban, al qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.', 'so we cant ignore those lessons of history.', 'now, on this issue of aiding pakistan, if youre going to aim a gun at somebody, george shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, youd better be prepared to pull the trigger.', 'im not prepared at this time to cut off aid to pakistan.', 'so im not prepared to threaten it, as senator obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into pakistan.', 'weve got to get the support of the people of -- of pakistan.', 'he said that he would launch military strikes into pakistan.', 'now, you dont do that.', 'you dont say that out loud.', 'if you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the pakistani government.', 'now, the new president of pakistan, kardari (sic), has got his hands full.', 'and this area on the border has not been governed since the days of alexander the great.', 'ive been to waziristan.', 'i can see how tough that terrain is.', 'its ruled by a handful of tribes.', 'and, yes, senator obama calls for more troops, but what he doesnt understand, its got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in iraq.', 'its going to have to be employed in afghanistan.', 'and were going to have to help the pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.', 'and its going to be tough.', 'theyve intermarried with al qaida and the taliban.', 'and its going to be tough.', 'but we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.', 'and the pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the marriott hotel in islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they dont want that government to cooperate with us in combating the taliban and jihadist elements.', 'so weve got a lot of work to do in afghanistan.', 'but im confident, now that general petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.', 'so its not just the addition of troops that matters.', 'its a strategy that will succeed.', 'and pakistan is a very important element in this.', 'and i know how to work with him.', 'and i guarantee you i would not publicly state that im going to attack them.obama: nobody talked about attacking pakistan.', 'heres what i said.', 'and if john wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the united states has al qaida, bin laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.', 'now, i think thats the right strategy; i think thats the right policy.', 'and, john, i -- youre absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.', 'but, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for north korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing iran, i dont know, you know, how credible that is.', 'i think this is the right strategy.', 'now, senator mccain is also right that its difficult.', 'this is not an easy situation.', 'youve got cross-border attacks against u.s. troops.', 'and weve got a choice.', 'we could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.', 'and the problem, john, with the strategy thats been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled musharraf, we alienated the pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.', 'we had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, well, you know, he may be a dictator, but hes our dictator.', 'and as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in pakistan.', 'we spent $10 billion.', 'and in the meantime, they werent going after al qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in afghanistan.', 'thats going to change when im president of the united states.mccain: i -- i dont think that senator obama understands that there was a failed state in pakistan when musharraf came to power.', 'everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.', 'but let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing iran and all that, let me tell you my record.', 'back in 1983, when i was a brand-new united states congressman, the one -- the person i admired the most and still admire the most, ronald reagan, wanted to send marines into lebanon.', 'and i saw that, and i saw the situation, and i stood up, and i voted against that, because i was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred marines would make a difference.', 'tragically, i was right: nearly 300 marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.', 'and then we had somalia -- then we had the first gulf war.', 'i supported -- i supported that.', 'i supported us going into bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in bosnia.', 'that was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of europe.', 'i supported what we did in kosovo.', 'i supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.', 'and i have a record -- and somalia, i opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.', 'so i have a record.', 'i have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way.', 'and ill tell you, i had a town hall meeting in wolfeboro, new hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, senator mccain, i want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it.', 'he was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of baghdad, matthew stanley, before christmas last year.', 'this was last august, a year ago.', 'and i said, i will -- i will wear his bracelet with honor.', 'and this was august, a year ago.', 'and then she said, but, senator mccain, i want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain.', 'that means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in baghdad, just like the mother i met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.', 'and they all say to me that we dont want defeat.mccain: a war that i was in, where we had an army, that it wasnt through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.', 'and i know how hard it is for that -- for an army and a military to recover from that.', 'and it did and we will win this one and we wont come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.obama: jim, let me just make a point.', 'ive got a bracelet, too, from sergeant - from the mother of sergeant ryan david jopeck (ph), given to me ingrain bin green bay.', 'she asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what im going through.', 'no u.s. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.', 'and we honor all the service that theyve provided.', 'our troops have performed brilliantly.', 'the question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep america safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.', 'and the point that i originally made is that we took our eye off afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and senator mccain, nobody is talking about defeat in iraq, but i have to say we are having enormous problems in afghanistan because of that decision.', 'and it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in afghanistan.', 'at one point, while you were focused on iraq, you said well, we can muddle through afghanistan.', 'you dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin laden.', 'you dont muddle through stamping out the taliban.', 'i think that is something we have to take seriously.', 'and when im president, i will.lehrer: new ...mccain: you might think that with that kind of concern that senator obama would have gone to afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.', 'by the way, when im subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.', 'but the important thing is -- the important thing is i visited afghanistan and i traveled to waziristan and i traveled to these places and i know what our security requirements are.', 'i know what our needs are.', 'so the point is that we will prevail in afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.', 'but the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in iraq, which general petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted senator obamas set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in afghanistan and american national security interests in the region.', 'senator obama doesnt seem to understand there is a connected between the two.lehrer: i have some good news and bad news for the two of you.', 'you all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering weve been going at it ...obama: a testimony to you, jim.lehrer: i dont know about that.', 'but the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, well adjust as we get there.', 'but the amount of time is even.', 'new lead question.', 'and it goes two minutes to you, senator mccain, what is your reading on the threat to iran right now to the security of the united states?mccain: my reading of the threat from iran is that if iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the state of israel and to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.', 'now we cannot a second holocaust.', 'lets just make that very clear.', 'what i have proposed for a long time, and ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk.', 'the russians are preventing significant action in the united nations security council.', 'i have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power.', 'we could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the iranians that i think could have a beneficial effect.', 'the iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.', 'so i am convinced that together, we can, with the french, with the british, with the germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect iranian behavior.', 'but have no doubt, but have no doubt that the iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.', 'and it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.', 'what id also like to point out the iranians are putting the most lethal ieds into iraq which are killing young americans, there are special groups in iran coming into iraq and are being trained in iran.', 'there is the republican guard in iran, which senator kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.', 'senator obama said that would be provocative.', 'so this is a serious threat.', 'this is a serious threat to security in the world, and i believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.lehrer: two minutes on iran, senator obama.obama: well, let me just correct something very quickly.', 'i believe the republican guard of iran is a terrorist organization.', 'ive consistently said so.', 'what senator mccain refers to is a measure in the senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of iraq.', 'to deal with iran.', 'and ironically, the single thing that has strengthened iran over the last several years has been the war in iraq.', 'iraq was irans mortal enemy.', 'that was cleared away.', 'and what weve seen over the last several years is irans influence grow.', 'they have funded hezbollah, they have funded hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.', 'so obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.', 'senator mccain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran.', 'it would be a game changer.', 'not only would it threaten israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this middle east.', 'now heres what we need to do.', 'we do need tougher sanctions.', 'i do not agree with senator mccain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with some countries like russia and china that are, i think senator mccain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with iran but potentially have an interest in making sure iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon.', 'but we are also going to have to, i believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with iran and this is a major difference i have with senator mccain, this notion by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.', 'it has not worked in iran, it has not worked in north korea.', 'in each instance, our efforts of isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.', 'that will change when im president of the united states.lehrer: senator, what about talking?mccain: senator obama twice said in debates he would sit down with ahmadinejad, chavez and raul castro without precondition.', 'without precondition.', 'here is ahmadinenene (ph), ahmadinejad, who is, ahmadinejad, who is now in new york, talking about the extermination of the state of israel, of wiping israel off the map, and were going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, theyve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.', 'the point is that throughout history, whether it be ronald reagan, who wouldnt sit down with brezhnev, andropov or chernenko until gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.', 'or whether it be nixons trip to china, which was preceded by henry kissinger, many times before he went.', 'look, ill sit down with anybody, but theres got to be pre-conditions.', 'those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldnt legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like ahmadinejad.', 'now, senator obama said, without preconditions.obama: so lets talk about this.', 'first of all, ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in iran.', 'so he may not be the right person to talk to.', 'but i reserve the right, as president of the united states to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if i think its going to keep america safe.', 'and im glad that senator mccain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.obama: senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger, whos one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with iran -- guess what -- without precondition.', 'this is one of your own advisers.', 'now, understand what this means without preconditions.', 'it doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day.', 'what it means is that we dont do what weve been doing, which is to say, until you agree to do exactly what we say, we wont have direct contacts with you.', 'theres a difference between preconditions and preparation.', 'of course weve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because iran is a rogue regime.', 'but i will point out that i was called naive when i suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with iran.', 'and you know what?', 'president bush recently sent a senior ambassador, bill burns, to participate in talks with the europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.', 'again, it may not work, but if it doesnt work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that senator mccain just mentioned.', 'and when we havent done it, as in north korea -- let me just take one more example -- in north korea, we cut off talks.', 'theyre a member of the axis of evil.', 'we cant deal with them.', 'and you know what happened?', 'they went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.', 'they tested a nuke.', 'they tested missiles.', 'they pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.', 'and they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like syria.', 'when we re-engaged -- because, again, the bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in north korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.', 'and -- and i just -- so i just have to make this general point that the bush administration, some of senator mccains own advisers all think this is important, and senator mccain appears resistant.', 'he even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of spain, because he -- you know, he wasnt sure whether they were aligned with us.', 'i mean, spain?', 'spain is a nato ally.mccain: of course.obama: if we cant meet with our friends, i dont know how were going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.mccain: im not going to set the white house visitors schedule before im president of the united states.', 'i dont even have a seal yet.', 'look, dr. kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the united states and the president -- and ahmadinejad.', 'he did not say that.obama: of course not.mccain: he said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.', 'ive always encouraged them.', 'the iranians have met with ambassador crocker in baghdad.', 'what senator obama doesnt seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called israel a stinking corpse, and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.', 'this is dangerous.', 'it isnt just naive; its dangerous.', 'and so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.', 'as far as north korea is concerned, our secretary of state, madeleine albright, went to north korea.', 'by the way, north korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on earth.', 'the average south korean is three inches taller than the average north korean, a huge gulag.', 'we dont know what the status of the dear leaders health is today, but we know this, that the north koreans have broken every agreement that theyve entered into.', 'and we ought to go back to a little bit of ronald reagans trust, but verify, and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as senator obama said he did twice, i mean, its just dangerous.obama: look, i mean, senator mccain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.', 'nobodys been talking about that, and senator mccain knows it.', 'this is a mischaracterization of my position.', 'when we talk about preconditions -- and henry kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.', 'and, you know, the bush administration has come to recognize that it hasnt worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.', 'and the notion that we would sit with ahmadinejad and not say anything while hes spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.', 'nobody is even talking about that.mccain: so let me get this right.', 'we sit down with ahmadinejad, and he says, were going to wipe israel off the face of the earth, and we say, no, youre not?', 'oh, please.obama: no, let me tell... (crosstalk)mccain: by the way, my friend, dr. kissinger, whos been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and senator obamas depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.', 'ive known him for 35 years.obama: we will take a look.mccain: and i guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.obama: nobodys talking about that.mccain: of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.', 'we do that all the time.lehrer: were going to go to a new... (crosstalk)mccain: and senator obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.obama: i am not parsing words.mccain: hes parsing words, my friends.obama: im using the same words that your advisers use.', 'please, go ahead.lehrer: new lead question.', 'russia, goes to you, two minutes, senator obama.', 'how do you see the relationship with russia?', 'do you see them as a competitor?', 'do you see them as an enemy?', 'do you see them as a potential partner?obama: well, i think that, given whats happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.', 'their actions in georgia were unacceptable.', 'they were unwarranted.', 'and at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.', 'they have to remove themselves from south ossetia and abkhazia.', 'it is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.', 'and we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the estonians, the lithuanians, the latvians, the poles, the czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.', 'they are members of nato.', 'and to countries like georgia and the ukraine, i think we have to insist that they are free to join nato if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.', 'now, we also cant return to a cold war posture with respect to russia.', 'its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.', 'one is nuclear proliferation.', 'they have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of al qaida.', 'this is an area where ive led on in the senate, working with a republican ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee, dick lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.', 'thats an area where were going to have to work with russia.', 'but we have to have a president who is clear that you dont deal with russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.', 'you deal with russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the united states of america?', 'and we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.lehrer: two minutes on russia, senator mccain.mccain: well, i was interested in senator obamas reaction to the russian aggression against georgia.', 'his first statement was, both sides ought to show restraint.', 'again, a little bit of naivete there.', 'he doesnt understand that russia committed serious aggression against georgia.', 'and russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a kgb apparatchik-run government.', 'i looked into mr. putins eyes, and i saw three letters, a k, a g, and a b. and their aggression in georgia is not acceptable behavior.', 'i dont believe were going to go back to the cold war.', 'i am sure that that will not happen.', 'but i do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.', 'and that wasnt just about a problem between georgia and russia.', 'it had everything to do with energy.', 'theres a pipeline that runs from the caspian through georgia through turkey.', 'and, of course, we know that the russians control other sources of energy into europe, which they have used from time to time.', 'its not accidental that the presidents of latvia, estonia, lithuania, poland, and ukraine flew to georgia, flew to tbilisi, where i have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, misha saakashvili.mccain: and they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the russian threats to regain their status of the old russian to regain their status of the old russian empire.', 'now, i think the russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the united states -- will support the inclusion of georgia and ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into nato.', 'we also ought to make it very clear that the russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.', 'they have stationed additional troops in abkhazia and south ossetia.', 'by the way, i went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.', 'and this is -- this is georgian territory.', 'and there was a huge poster of vladimir putin, and it said, vladimir putin, our president.', 'it was very clear, the russian intentions towards georgia.', 'they were just waiting to seize the opportunity.', 'so, this is a very difficult situation.', 'we want to work with the russians.', 'but we also have every right to expect the russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.', 'and watch ukraine.', 'this whole thing has got a lot to do with ukraine, crimea, the base of the russian fleet in sevastopol.', 'and the breakdown of the political process in ukraine between tymoshenko and yushchenko is a very serious problem.', 'so watch ukraine, and lets make sure that we -- that the ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.lehrer: you see any -- do you have a major difference with what he just said?obama: no, actually, i think senator mccain and i agree for the most part on these issues.', 'obviously, i disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to russians going into georgia.', 'i immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.', 'and, absolutely, i wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on georgia, and thats why i was the first to say that we have to rebuild the georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.', 'because part of russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where president saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that putin favored more.', 'two points i think are important to think about when it comes to russia.', 'number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.', 'so back in april, i warned the administration that you had russian peacekeepers in georgian territory.', 'that made no sense whatsoever.', 'and what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.', 'that wasnt done.', 'but had it been done, its possible we could have avoided the issue.', 'the second point i want to make is -- is the issue of energy.', 'russia is in part resurgent and putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as senator mccain mentioned.', 'that means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the worlds oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about, iran, venezuela.', 'and that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil.', 'so we cant simply drill our way out of the problem.', 'what were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.', 'and, you know, ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.', 'and i have to say, senator mccain and i, i think agree on the importance of energy, but senator mccain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.', 'over 26 years, senator mccain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.', 'and so we -- we -- weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winters coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important.lehrer: weve got time for one more lead question segment.', 'were way out of... (crosstalk)lehrer: quick response and then... (crosstalk)mccain: no one from arizona is against solar.', 'and senator obama says hes for nuclear, but hes against reprocessing and hes against storing.', 'so...obama: thats just not true, john.', 'john, im sorry, but thats not true.mccain: ... its hard to get there from here.', 'and off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.', 'and we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.', 'and it will have, i think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.obama: i just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.mccain: so i want to say that, with the nunn-lugar thing...lehrer: excuse me, senator.obama: john?mccain: ... i supported nunn-lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didnt.', 'that was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.obama: i -- i just have to correct the record here.', 'i have never said that i object to nuclear waste.', 'what ive said is that we have to store it safely.', 'and, senator mccain, he says -- he talks about arizona.lehrer: all right.obama: ive got to make this point, jim.lehrer: ok.obama: he objects...mccain: i have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...obama: he -- he -- he objects... (crosstalk)lehrer: one at a time, please.obama: he objected...lehrer: one at a time.mccain: no one can be opposed to alternate energy.obama: all right, fair enough.', 'lets move on.', 'youve got one more energy -- youve got one more question.lehrer: this is the last -- last lead question.', 'you have two minutes each.', 'and the question is this, beginning with you, senator mccain.', 'what do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental united states?mccain: i think its much less than it was the day after 9/11.', 'i think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.', 'and i want to tell you that one of the things im most proud of, among others, because i have worked across the aisle.', 'i have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.', 'but after 9/11, senator joe lieberman and i decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.', 'and we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where i differed with this administration.', 'and we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on washington, and we got that legislation passed.', 'and there were a series of recommendations, as i recall, more than 40. and im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.', 'im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, democrat and republican alike.', 'so we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.', 'we have to do a better job in human intelligence.', 'and weve got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again.', 'we have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.', 'we have to work more closely with our allies.', 'i know our allies, and i can work much more closely with them.', 'but i can tell you that i think america is safer today than it was on 9/11.', 'but that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go.', 'and id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the defense department.', 'and i think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.', 'but we still have a long way to go before we can declare america safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.lehrer: two minutes, senator obama.obama: well, first of all, i think that we are safer in some ways.', 'obviously, weve poured billions of dollars into airport security.', 'we have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.', 'weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites.', 'we havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports.', 'and the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.', 'its in a suitcase.', 'this is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.', 'it is the -- the biggest threat to the united states is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.', 'and we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.', 'and i actually believe that we need missile defense, because of iran and north korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but i also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake.', 'the other thing that we have to focus on, though, is al qaida.', 'they are now operating in 60 countries.', 'we cant simply be focused on iraq.', 'we have to go to the root cause, and that is in afghanistan and pakistan.', 'thats going to be critical.', 'we are going to need more cooperation with our allies.', 'and one last point i want to make.', 'it is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.', 'and one of the things that i intend to do as president is to restore americas standing in the world.', 'we are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.obama: and this is the greatest country on earth.', 'but because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and i give senator mccain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, i think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that america is that shining beacon on a hill.lehrer: do you agree theres much to be done in a new administration to restore... (crosstalk)mccain: but in the case of missile defense, senator obama said it had to be, quote, proven.', 'that wasnt proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi, which is missile defense.', 'and it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the cold war.', 'we seem to come full circle again.', 'senator obama still doesnt quite understand -- or doesnt get it -- that if we fail in iraq, it encourages al qaida.', 'they would establish a base in iraq.', 'the consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that weve made of american blood and treasure, which grieves us all.', 'all of that would be lost if we followed senator obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.', 'and general petraeus says we have had great success, but its very fragile.', 'and we cant do what senator obama wants to do.', 'that is the central issue of our time.', 'and i think americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the united states.lehrer: you see the same connections that senator mccain does?obama: oh, theres no doubt.', 'look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with senator mccain, have been solely focused on iraq.', 'that has been their priority.', 'that has been where all our resources have gone.', 'in the meantime, bin laden is still out there.', 'he is not captured.', 'he is not killed.', 'al qaida is resurgent.', 'in the meantime, weve got challenges, for example, with china, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.', 'they now hold a trillion dollars worth of our debt.', 'and they are active in countries like -- in regions like latin america, and asia, and africa.', 'they are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because weve been focused on iraq.', 'we have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.', 'we are now spending $10 billion or more every month.', 'and that means we cant provide health care to people who need it.', 'we cant invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.', 'there has never been a country on earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.', 'so this is a national security issue.', 'we havent adequately funded veterans care.', 'i sit on the veterans affairs committee, and weve got -- i meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, how can i get disability payments?', 'ive got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet i cant get treatment.', 'so we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.', 'what we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.', 'thats been missing over the last eight years.', 'that sense is something that i want to restore.mccain: ive been involved, as i mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge weve faced in the last 20-some years.', 'there are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.', 'and i -- and i honestly dont believe that senator obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to russian invasion -- aggression in georgia, to his -- you know, weve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the united states than that.', 'as far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, i know the veterans.', 'i know them well.', 'and i know that they know that ill take care of them.', 'and ive been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.', 'and i love them.', 'and ill take care of them.', 'and they know that ill take care of them.', 'and thats going to be my job.', 'but, also, i have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.', 'reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the united states of america.', 'i dont think i need any on-the-job training.', 'im ready to go at it right now.obama: well, let me just make a closing point.', 'you know, my father came from kenya.', 'thats where i get my name.', 'and in the 60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the united states because the notion was that there was no other country on earth where you could make it if you tried.', 'the ideals and the values of the united states inspired the entire world.', 'i dont think any of us can

homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest-hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if theyre not yet

market.', 'and just like the health care law that we put in place, obamacare -- (applause) -- which, by the way, if you dont have health insurance or youre buying it at exorbitant rates on the

what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, i believe that our housing

climb their way into the middle class, weve got to do what we can to make housing affordable.', 'and that means weve got to strengthen the fha so it gives today’s families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity.and weve got to support, as i said, affordable rental housing.', 'and, by the way, weve also got to keep up our fight against homelessness.', '(applause.)', 'the mayor of phoenix has been doing a great job here in phoenix on that front.', 'weve got to continue to improve it.', '(applause.', ')since i

few basics of the tax code that buffetts op-ed takes for granted.', 'this review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.income taxes.', 'federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money.', 'lets take a married couple filing jointly as an example.', 'in 2011, after deductions and exemptions:• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.keep in mind that even if youre in the top bracket of 35 percent, you dont pay that tax rate on all your income.', 'you pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.payroll taxes.', 'payroll taxes are separate from income taxes.', 'if you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government.', 'these taxes pay for social security and medicare; its listed as fica on your pay stub.', 'typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for social security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for medicare hospital coverage.', 'the employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for social security and 2.9 percent for medicare.', 'last year, though, president barack obama and congress knocked 2 percentage points off social security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure.', 'so this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent.', 'oh, and if youre self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income.', 'payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates dont get higher the more you earn.', 'in the case of the social security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.head hurt yet?', 'ours, too.taxes on investments.', 'okay, now were getting closer to buffetts main point here, and thats taxes on investments.', 'the tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income.', 'if you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as carried interest and taxed as a capital gain.', '(the wall street journal breaks down how carried interest works.)', 'in fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains.', 'defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship.', 'they also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends.', 'we wont settle the argument here, but theres no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.getting back to buffetts op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other.', 'the fact were checking here is that the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes, while middle class taxpayers fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.hes right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job.', 'very little of this taxpayers income is wage income, so payroll taxes dont take much of a bite.', 'it seems likely that much of this hypothetical persons income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate.', 'and, in fact, as buffett says, statistics from the internal revenue service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.on the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates.', 'it gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan tax policy center.buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if youre in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent.', 'and, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income.', 'were dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as buffett claims someone in his office now pays.', '(the top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the tax policy center.)', 'we contacted buffetts offices as berkshire hathaway about this point but didnt hear back.one final note: people who dont pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income.', 'when buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, hes thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.so when it comes to buffetts statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really

federal government?', 'its already spending 21% of the entire u.s. economy.', 'how much larger would government be in the lives of americans under a sanders presidency?sanders: well, to put that in a context, judy, i think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.', 'in other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.what i believe is the united states, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.', 'our medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.i do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.', 'i believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, flint, michigan comes to mind.', 'our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.woodruff: but, my question is how big would government be?', 'would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...sanders: ... of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on earth.', 'yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.', 'clinton: judy, i think that the best analysis that ive seen based on senator sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- lets take healthcare for example.last week in a cnn town hall, the senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.', 'every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers dont add up, and thats a promise that cannot be kept, and its really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.', 'this is about peoples lives, and we should level with the american people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.sanders: well, let us level with the american people.', 'secretary clinton has been going around the country saying bernie sanders wants to dismantle the affordable care act, people are going to lose their medicaid, theyre going to lose their chip program.i have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.', 'were not going to dismantle everything.', 'but, here is the truth.twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in america.', 'we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.', 'one out of five americans cant even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.', 'millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.', 'what i said, and let me repeat it, i dont know what economists secretary clinton is talking to, but what i have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.in my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and i will fight for that.clinton: i can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.', 'you know, before it was called obamacare, it was called hillarycare.', 'and i took on the drug companies and i took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.', '(applause)and why i am a staunch supporter of president obamas principal accomplishment -- namely the affordable care act -- is because i know how hard it was to get that done.', 'we are at 90 percent coverage.', 'we have to get the remaining 10. ive set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.and it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.', 'but i think the american people deserve to know specifically how this would work.', 'if its medicare for all, then you no longer have the affordable care act, because the affordable care act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.', 'the childrens health insurance program, which i helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.so if youre having medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.', 'and based on every analysis that i can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers dont add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.ifill: final thought, senator.sanders: that is absolutely inaccurate.', 'look, here is the reality, folks.', 'there is one major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.', 'there is one major country -- the united states -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the u.k. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in france guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and heres the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.clinton: well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...(applause)... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, i believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.', 'i believe we are on the path to doing that.', 'the last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.and we are not england.', 'we are not france.', 'we inherited a system that was set up during world war ii; 170 million americans get health insurance right now through their employers.', 'so what we have tried to do and what president obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.', 'we have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. i far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.', '(applause)ifill: id like to move along.', 'id like to move along.secretary clinton, you might -- you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government.', 'you may remember this pledge from a state of the union address at which i believe you were present, in which these words were said: the era of big government is over.', 'you may remember that.when asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of new hampshire democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied.', 'given what you and senator sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for americans who fear government to fear you?clinton: no.', 'but it is absolutely fair and necessary for americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average american family?in my case, whether its health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, i have been very specific about where i would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how i would move this agenda forward.ive tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because i feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, gwen, that you are mentioning.', 'there is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.', 'im aware of that.', 'it comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.clinton: so we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why i think we should not make promises we cant keep, because that will further, i think, alienate americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in peoples lives.ifill: but i havent heard either of you put a price tag on your -- you say...(crosstalk)clinton: i will put a price tag.', 'my price tag is about $100 billion a year.', 'and again, paid for.', 'and what i have said is i will not throw us further into debt.', 'i believe i can get the money that i need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.and i think once im in the white house we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.but i am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.ifill: senator?sanders: well, secretary clinton, youre not in the white house yet.', 'and let us be clear that every proposal that i have introduced has been paid for.', 'for example, all right, who in america denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?', 'roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?', 'who denies that african-american youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.we need to create jobs.', 'so yes, i will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the cayman islands and bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.yes, im going to do away with that.', 'we will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.', 'yes, i believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on wall street, that they are a wall street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the great recession -- great depression.yes, i do believe that now after the american people bailed wall street out, yes, they should pay a wall street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.we bailed them out.', 'now it is their time to help the middle class.', '(applause)clinton: you know, i think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young americans.', 'and i have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.we differ, however, on a couple of key points.', 'one of them being that if you dont have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, its hard to get to where we need to go.and senator sanderss plan really rests on making sure that governors like scott walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.', 'i am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.', '(applause)woodruff: next, were going to...sanders: a brief response.woodruff: very brief, thank you.sanders: here is where we are with public education.', 'a 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.', 'like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.and that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.', 'the world has changed.', 'this is 2016. in many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.so, yes, i do believe that when we talk about public education in america, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.', 'that should be a right of all americans regardless of the income of their families.', '(applause)woodruff: secretary clinton, your campaign -- you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters.', 'you have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president.but in new hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for senator sanders.', 'what are women missing about you?clinton: well, first, judy, i have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.', 'i believe that its most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.and i feel very strongly that i have an agenda, i have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.', 'so im going to keep making that case.', 'im going to keep making sure that everything ive done, everything that i stand for is going to be well known.but i have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.', 'i just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.', 'thats what im working towards.', '(applause)woodruff: as you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former secretary of state madeleine albright, said the other day that theres a special place in hell for women who dont support other women.', 'do you agree with what she said?clinton: well, look, i think that shes been saying that for as long as ive known her, which is about 25 years.', 'but it doesnt change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.', 'thats what ive always stood for.and when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether were going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, i think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why thats at the core of my campaign.i would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today weve had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.', 'so, you know, well take our progress wherever we can find it.', '(applause)woodruff: senator sanders, youre in the minority, but we still want to hear from you.', '(laughter) sanders: look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, african-americans, latinos, asian-americans.', 'we are trying to bring america together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.i am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- i think i am -- that i have a lifetime -- and ive been in congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.', 'i am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of vermont from very significant majorities of women.im very proud that i support legislation that is currently in the congress, got support of almost all progressive democrats in the house and senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.', 'and we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.', '(applause)ifill: senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as senator clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?sanders: well, you know, i think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, i think a sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.', '(applause)clinton: you know, i have said -- i have said many times, you know, im not asking people to support me because im a woman.', 'im asking people to support me because i think im the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.', '(applause)and i appreciate greatly senator sanders voting record.', 'and i was very proud to get the endorsement of the planned parenthood action fund, because ive been a leader on these issues.', 'i have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep womens health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.clinton: im very proud that naral endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on womens issues.', 'somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back womens rights.so im asking women, im asking men, to support me because im ready to go into the white house on january 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.', '(applause)woodruff: final comment.sanders: let me concur with the secretary, no question womens rights are under fierce attack all over this country.', 'and i will tell you something that really galls me.', 'i will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.', 'just a little bit.all over this country we have republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.', 'government is the enemy.', 'were going to cut social security to help you.', 'were going to cut medicare and medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.but, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in america.if thats not hypocrisy, i dont know what hypocrisy is.', '(applause)ifill: thank you both.ifill: we turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at facebook.', 'they were selected from a curated group of people weve been following of undecided voters.the first comes from claudia looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in madison, wisconsin.', 'and she writes: wisconsin is number one in african-american male incarceration, according to a university of wisconsin study.', 'they found that wisconsins incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the countrys rate.', 'what can we do across the nation to address this?senator sanders.sanders: this is one of the great tragedies in our country today.', 'and we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.', 'it has to be dealt with.', 'today a male african-american baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.', 'that is beyond unspeakable.so what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.', '(applause)sanders: what we have to do is end over-policing in african- american neighborhoods.', 'the reality is that both the african-american community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.the reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.', 'truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.', 'the truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.we need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.', 'i would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often african-americans, shot by police officers.what we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.', '(applause)clinton: you know, i completely agree with senator sanders.', 'the first speech i gave in this campaign back in april was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.the statistics from wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for african-americans in our nation, twice the national average.', 'and we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of dontre hamilton right here in milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.his family certainly believes that.', 'and so do i. so we have work to do.', 'there have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.', 'president obamas policing commission came out with some.', 'i have fully endorsed those.clinton: but we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.and, then we have to go after sentencing, and thats one of the problems here in wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesnt happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.but, i would also add this.', 'there are other racial discrepancies.', 'really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.', 'so, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.', '(applause)sanders: nothing that secretary clinton said do i disagree with.', 'this mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.', 'it takes away discretion from judges.', 'we have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.', '(applause)we have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.', 'and, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.', 'people are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- were shocked that they end up back in jail again.', 'so, we have a lot of work to do.but, here is a pledge ive made throughout this campaign, and its really not a very radical pledge.', 'when we have more people in jail, disproportionately african american and latino, than china does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.', 'heres my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.we will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.', '(applause) woodruff: secretary clinton, i was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for president obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example.', 'hardly anyone believes that they have.', 'why do you think race relations would be better under a clinton presidency?', 'what would you do that the nations first african american has not been able to?clinton: well, im just not sure i agree completely with that assessment.', 'i think under president obama we have seen a lot of advances, the affordable care act has helped more african americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.', 'we have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.so, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.', 'i think president obama has set a great example.', 'i think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.', 'now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.we now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.', 'we now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.', 'i think what president obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first african american president, and to address it both from the presidents office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and mrs. obamas work with young women.but, we cant rest.', 'we have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.', 'so, its going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.', 'nobody can deny them.', 'to use the justice department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.', 'so, were going to enforce the law, were going to change policing practices, were going to change incarceration practices, but were also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.', '(applause)woodruff: senator sanders?', '(applause)sanders: well, i think, judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on wall street, millions of lives were hurt.', 'people lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.', 'turns out that the african-american community and the latino community were hit especially hard.', 'as i understand it, the african-american community lost half of their wealth as a result of the wall street collapse.so when you have childhood african-american poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.', 'we are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.', 'and sadly, in america today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are african-american.woodruff: so race relation was be better under a sanders presidency than theyve been?sanders: absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so theyre not hanging out on street corners.', 'were going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.and i think when you give low-income kids -- african-american, white, latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.', 'theyre going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.', '(applause)ifill: let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about african-americans, people of color.', 'i want to talk about white people, ok?sanders: white people?ifill: i know.', '(laughter)so many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country.', 'by the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite.', 'our public schools are already there.', 'if working- class, white americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, dont they have a reason to be resentful, senator -- secretary clinton?clinton: look, i am deeply concerned about whats happening in every community in america, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.', 'people with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.', 'this is a remarkable and horrifying fact.and thats why ive come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.', 'you know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?', 'do people not care about all of our sacrifice?and im going to do everything i can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.i particularly appreciate the proposal that congressman jim clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.', 'and you know what?', 'if you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.so, yes, i do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.', 'and thats why, as president, i will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.', '(applause)ifill: senator -- senator, i want you to respond to that, but i also want you to -- am i wrong?', 'is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?sanders: yeah, you can, because african-americans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.', 'so, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.', 'but it is a general economic issue.sanders: and heres what the economic issue is.the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.', 'why is that?', 'because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china, secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues.but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.', 'now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.', 'but you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.you once had a pension.', 'those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.', 'theyre off to china.', 'now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.what have you got now?', 'you are working at mcdonalds?', 'that is why there is massive despair all over this country.', 'people have worked their entire lives.', 'theyre making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.', 'their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.and thats why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.suicide, alcoholism, drugs, thats why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.', '(applause)woodruff: thank you.senator sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class americans is connected to immigrants.', 'president obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the united states to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits.would you go further than that?', 'and if so, how specifically would you do it?', 'should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a sanders presidency?sanders: the answer is yes.', 'weve got 11 million undocumented people in this country.', 'i have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.i believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that i strongly supported.', 'i believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.', 'i agree with president obama who used executive orders to protect families because the congress, the house was unable or refused to act.and in fact i would go further.', 'what would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.and let me say this also.', 'somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, i disagree with his recent deportation policies.', 'and i would not support those.bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if congress doesnt do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.', '(applause)clinton: i strongly support the presidents executive actions.', 'i hope the supreme court upholds them.', 'i think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.i am against the raids.', 'im against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.', 'we should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.im a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.', 'have been ever since i was in the senate.', 'i was one of the original sponsors of the dream act.', 'i voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.senator sanders voted against it at that time.', 'because i think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.', 'and as president i would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of congress that i thought i could persuade.hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.', 'and they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.', '(applause)sanders: secretary clinton, i do have a disagreement here.', 'if my memory is correct, i think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, i thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.', 'that was not, as i understand it, the secretarys position.in terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, i did vote against it.', 'i voted against it because the southern poverty law center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.', 'akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, theyd be thrown out of this country.so it wasnt just me who opposed it.', 'it was lulac, one of the large latino organizations in this country.', 'it was the afl-cio.', 'it was some of the most progressive members of the united states congress who opposed it for that reason.but we are where we are right now.', 'and where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.', 'what we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.clinton: two quick responses.', 'one, with respect to the central american children, i made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in central america not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.ive also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which i think are really against the common good and the rule of law.and with respect to the 2007 bill, this was ted kennedys bill.', 'and i think ted kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.', 'and i was proud to stand with him and support it.', '(applause)woodruff: id like... sanders: well, let me just respond.', 'i worked with ted kennedy.', 'he was the chairman of my committee.', 'and i loved ted kennedy.', 'but on this issue, when you have one of the large latino organizations in america saying vote no, and you have the afl-cio saying vote no, and you have leading progressive democrats, in fact, voting no, i dont apologize for that vote.but in terms of the children, i dont know to whom youre sending a message.', 'who are you sending a message to?', 'these are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake.', 'that was the fact.', 'i dont think we use them to send a message.', 'i think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together.', '(applause)clinton: well, that just wasnt -- that just wasnt the fact, senator.', 'the fact is that there was a great effort made by the obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.so we have a disagreement on this.', 'i think now what ive called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.', '(applause)ifill: if you would allow me now to move on, weve been talking about children.', 'i want to talk about seniors.', 'that takes us to our second facebook question from farheen hakeem, who writes, my father -- shes a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in milwaukee.', 'and she writes, my father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of medicaids family community program in milwaukee county for low-income seniors.', 'how will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?start with you, senator sanders.sanders: ok. you know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.', 'and by those standards, were not doing particularly well.sanders: we have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on earth.', 'and in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and ive talked to them in my state of vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year social security.', 'and you know what?', 'you do the arithmetic.', 'you cant get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.and heres an area where secretary clinton and i believe we have a difference.', 'i have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the social security trust fund, starting at $250,000.', '(applause)and when we -- and when we do that, we dont do what the republicans want, which is to cut social security.', 'we do what the american people want, to expand social security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of social security for 58 years.yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.', 'but a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they dont have decent nutrition, where they cant heat their homes in the wintertime.', 'that is not what america should be about.', 'if elected president, i will do everything i can to expand social security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.', '(applause)clinton: i think -- i think its fair to say we dont have a disagreement.', 'we both believe there has to be more money going into the social security system.', 'ive said im looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the social security trust fund.i have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.', 'first, rather than expand benefits for everyone, i do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.', 'i want to take care of women.', 'when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.', 'and women have been disadvantaged ever since.', 'they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.', 'and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment.', 'so we have no disagreement about the need to buttress social security, get more revenue into the program.', 'but i want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who dont believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.sanders: in all due respect...(applause)sanders: in all due respect, secretary clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.', 'are you coming onboard a proposal?', 'and what is that proposal?now, the proposal that i have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially barack obama campaigned on in 2008. you opposed him then.i would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.', 'were asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.', 'i hope you will make a decision soon on this.clinton: well, senator, look, i think were in vigorous agreement here.', 'we both want to get more revenue in.', 'i have yet to see a proposal that youre describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.', 'that has not been...sanders: thats my bill.', 'check it out.clinton: well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that ive seen.', 'im interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.', 'so im going to come up with the best way forward.', 'were going to end up in the same place.', 'were going to get more revenue.', 'im going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.', '(applause)woodruff: were going to move on.', 'secretary clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of senator sanders for attending democratic party fundraisers from which you say he benefited.', 'but nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, george soros and donald sussman, for a total of about $10 million.woodruff: you have said that theres no quid pro quo involved.', 'is that also true of the donations that wealthy republicans give to republican candidates, contributors including the koch brothers?clinton: i cant speak for the koch brothers, youre referring to a super pac that we dont coordinate with, that was set up to support president obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.', 'they are the ones who should respond to any questions.lets talk about our campaigns.', 'im very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.', 'so, im proud of senator sanders, and his supporters.', 'i think its great that senator sanders, president obama and i have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the democratic side.', 'thats the way it should be, and im going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as senator sanders is.i think that is the real key here.', 'we both have a lot of small donors.', 'i think that sets us apart from a lot of whats happening right now on the republican side.the koch brothers have a very clear political agenda.', 'it is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.', 'were going to fight it as hard as we can, and were going to fight whoever the republicans nominate who will depend on the koch brothers, and others.', '(applause)woodruff: im asking if democratic donors are different than republican donors.sanders: what we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, thats what were talking about.', 'we have to be honest about it.', 'it is undermining american democracy.when extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to super pacs, and in many cases in this campaign, super pacs have raised more money than individual candidates have, ok?', 'we had a decision to make early on, do we do a super pac?', 'and, we said no.', 'we dont represent wall street, we dont represent the billionaire class, so it ends up im the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no super pac.', 'but, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.', 'and, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would i have believed that i would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.now, secretary clintons super pac, as i understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from wall street.', 'our average contribution is $27 dollars, im very proud of that.', '(applause)ifill: senator sanders, are you saying...clinton: we are mixing apples and oranges.', 'my 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.', 'im very proud.', 'that, i think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.but, the real issue, i think, that the senator is injecting into this is that if you had a super pac, like president obama has, which now says it wants to support me.', 'its not my pac.', 'if you take donations from wall street, you cant be independent.i would just say, i debated then senator obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of wall street donations of anybody running on the democratic side ever.now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on wall street.', 'he pushed through, and he passed the dodd-frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930s.', 'so, lets not in anyway imply here that either president obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether its wall street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do whats best for the american people.', '(applause)sanders: the people arent dumb.', 'why in gods name does wall street...(applause)but lets not -- but lets not -- lets not insult -- lets not insult the intelligence of the american people.', 'people arent dumb.', 'why in gods name does wall street make huge campaign contributions?', 'i guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.', '(laughter)why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?', 'any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?', 'any connection to the fact that not one republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?', '(applause)and when we talk about wall street, lets talk about wall street.', 'i voted for dodd-frank, got an important amendment in it.', 'in my view, it doesnt go anywhere near far enough.', 'but when we talk about wall street, you have wall street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.', 'no wall street executive has been prosecuted.', '(applause)clinton: well, lets just -- lets just follow up on this, because, you know, ive made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of dodd-frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the federal reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.', 'i think thats a major accomplishment.i agree, however, it doesnt go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which senator sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.', 'i go further in the plan that ive proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.', 'it was an investment bank, lehman brothers, that contributed to our collapse.', 'it was a big insurance company, aig.', 'it was countrywide mortgage.', 'my plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.and i believe that not only barney frank, paul krugman, and others, have said that what i have proposed is the most effective.', 'it goes in the right direction.', 'we have dodd-frank.', 'we can use it to break up the banks, if thats appropriate.', 'but lets not kid ourselves.', 'as we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.', 'i want to get ahead of those, and thats why ive proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...(crosstalk)(applause)woodruff: we have to go to a break.', 'we...sanders: let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with secretary clinton here.', 'when you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the gdp of america, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, i think if teddy roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.', 'i think he would have been right.', 'i think he would have said bring back a 21st-century glass-steagall legislation.', 'i think that would have been right, as well.', 'thats my view.', '(applause)woodruff: all right.', 'thank you both.', 'it is time for a break.', 'and when we come back, were going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep america safe.ifill: theres a lot more to come in just a few minutes.', 'stay with us for more of the pbs newshour democratic debate.', '(break)woodruff: welcome back to the democratic presidential debate.', 'before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our facebook group.', 'and it is to senator sanders.senator, it comes from bill corfield.', 'he is a 55-year-old musician from troy, ohio.', 'and he asks: are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?sanders: hey, im in the united states senate, and anyone who doesnt think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.i believe in government, but i believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.ifill: how about you, senator clinton -- secretary clinton?clinton: absolutely.', 'and, you know, there are a number of programs that i think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.', 'there are a lot of training programs and education programs that i think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.i would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that were taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we dont need anymore.', 'and thats what i intend to do.sanders: if i could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the department of defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.', 'and i have the feeling youre going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.', '(applause)ifill: we spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity.', 'the second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities.', 'and we want to start with a question for you, secretary clinton, about americas role in the world.americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here.', 'according to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of democrats in new hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they cant win.', 'they fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready.', 'are we?clinton: look, i think we are readier than we used to be, but its a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.', 'we have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in san bernardino and know that we havent done enough.so we have to go after this both abroad and at home.', 'we have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly isis -- thats not the only one, but lets focus on that for a minute.', 'we have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from isis.', 'that is principally an american-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.we have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the arabs and the kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from raqqa to ramadi.', 'we have to continue to work with the iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside iraq, like mosul, when they are able to do so.', 'and we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.and we have to take on isis online.', 'they are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.here at home, weve got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.', 'we need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where its needed.but the final thing i want to say about this is the following.', 'you know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in new york was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.', 'and we need to do that throughout the country.but we need to understand that american muslims are on the front line of our defense.', 'they are more likely to know whats happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the american society.', 'so when somebody like donald trump and others...(applause)... stirs up the demagoguery against american muslims, that hurts us at home.', 'its not only offensive; its dangerous.', 'and the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of muslim nations.', 'i know how to do that.', 'i put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.', '(applause)and you dont go tell muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the united states who insults their religion.so this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.ifill: senator sanders...sanders: let me just say this.', 'what a president of the united states has got to do -- and what is his or her major, i think, responsibility -- is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...... president of the united states has got to do, and what is his or her major, i think, responsibility, is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe.', 'that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.', 'that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didnt believe them.', 'and if you go to my web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change.', 'look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator.', 'we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to.', 'we got rid of gadhafi.', 'but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, its to understand what happens the day after.and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi.', 'but what happened is a political vacuum developed.', 'isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.but this is nothing new.', 'this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments.', 'mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran.', 'he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british.', 'and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator.', 'the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.', 'unintended consequences.so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences.', 'i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east.', '(applause)clinton: if i could just respond.', 'two points.', 'one, senator sanders voted in 1998 on what i think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to iraq, calling for the end of saddam husseins regime.he voted in favor of regime change with libya, voted in favor of the security council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.i do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat isis in 2016. its very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.when people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.', 'and its important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.as we all remember, senator obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in iraq.', 'and yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.i was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.', '(applause)sanders: judy, if i can, there is no question, secretary clinton and i are friends, and i have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.', 'secretary of state for four years.', 'youve got a bit of experience, i would imagine.but judgment matters as well.', 'judgment matters as well.', 'and she and i looked at the same evidence coming from the bush administration regarding iraq.', 'i lead the opposition against it.', 'she voted for it.but more importantly, in terms of this libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.', 'everybody voted for it wanting to see libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.sanders: that is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which i did not support.clinton: you did support a u.n. security council approach, which we did follow up on.', 'and, look, i think its important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin laden.i looked at the evidence.', 'i looked at the intelligence.', 'i got the briefings.', 'i recommended that the president go forward.', 'it was a hard choice.', 'not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.', 'and at the end of the day, it was the presidents decision.', 'so he had to leave the situation room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.', 'im proud that i gave him that advice.', 'and im very grateful to the brave navy seals who carried out that mission.', '(applause)sanders: judy, one area very briefly...woodruff: just a final word.sanders: where the secretary and i have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and i believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of henry kissinger.', 'now, i find it rather amazing, because i happen to believe that henry kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.', '(applause)i am proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend.', 'i will not take advice from henry kissinger.', 'and in fact, kissingers actions in cambodia, when the united states bombed that country, overthrew prince sihanouk, created the instability for pol pot and the khmer rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.', 'so count me in as somebody who will not be listening to henry kissinger.', '(applause)ifill: secretary clinton?', 'clinton: well, i know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.sanders: well, it aint henry kissinger.', 'thats for sure.clinton: thats fine.', 'thats fine.', '(laughter)you know, i listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.', 'i think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to china, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up china and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of china is an incredibly useful relationship for the united states of america.', '(applause)so if we want to pick and choose -- and i certainly do -- people i listen to, people i dont listen to, people i listen to for certain areas, then i think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because its a big, complicated world out there.sanders: it is.clinton: and, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the united states.', '(applause)sanders: i find -- i mean, its just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.', 'kissinger was one of those people during the vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.', 'not everybody remembers that.', 'you do.', 'i do.', 'the domino theory, you know, if vietnam goes, china, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.', 'thats what he talked about, the great threat of china.and then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, youre right, he opened up relations with china, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in american workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to china.', 'the terrible, authoritarian, communist dictatorship he warned us about, now hes urging companies to shut down and move to china.', 'not my kind of guy.', '(applause)woodruff: senator, let me -- let me move on to another country with which the u.s. has a complicated relationship, senator sanders, and thats russia.', 'on the one hand, were aware that russia is a country that the united states needs to cooperate with.woodruff: just tonight, secretary of state john kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the russians to lead -- that could lead toward a ceasefire in syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all -- have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits president assad, has not gone after isis.so my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with russia, are you prepared -- how hard are you prepared to be?', 'are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions?', 'would you be prepared to move militarily if russia moves on eastern europe?', 'it seems to me that russia recently has gotten the better of the united states.sanders: well, this is what i would say.', 'it is a complicated relationship.', 'i congratulate secretary of state john kerry and the president for working on this agreement.as youve indicated, what is happening in syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.', 'it is a real horror.now, what i think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with russia.', 'but lets be clear: russias aggressive actions in the crimea and in ukraine have brought about a situation where president obama and nato -- correctly, i believe -- are saying, you know what, were going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.i happen to believe that putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and hes trying to rally his people in support of him.', 'but bottom line is: the president is right.', 'we have to put more money.', 'we have to work with nato to protect eastern europe against any kind of russian aggression.sanders: well, with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made.', 'the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria.the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to.', 'you know, the russians wanted to buy time.', 'are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate whats left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?', 'so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.but i would add this.', 'you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution.', 'at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together.this is incredibly complicated, because weve got iran as a big player, in addition to russia.', 'we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.this is one of the areas ive disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake.', 'putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me.', 'trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.so lets support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but lets hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy whats left of the opposition.', 'and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups.so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like.', 'so weve got some real work to do, and lets try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.', '(applause)sanders: let me just -- just say this.', 'for a start, the secretary and i disagree -- and i think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in syria.i think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as i mentioned a moment ago.', 'i applaud secretary kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.', 'lets hope that it holds.sanders: but furthermore, what we have got to do, im sorry, yes, i do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.', 'but i do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with cuba.and by the way, i hope we can end the trade embargo with cuba as well.', 'but the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something i want to achieve.and i believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.', 'thats how you make peace in the world.', 'you sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding iran stop the support of international terrorism.', '(applause)clinton: well, i respectfully disagree.', 'i think we have achieved a great deal with the iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the iranian nuclear weapons program.', 'that has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.i do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with iran.', 'yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.', 'yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the middle east, causing even more chaos.yes, theyve got to get out of syria.', 'theyve got to quit sponsoring hezbollah and hamas.', 'they have got to quit trying to ship rockets into gaza that can be used against israel.we have a lot of work to do with iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.', '(applause)sanders: we have a lot of work to do.', 'we have a lot of work to do.', 'but i recall when secretary clinton ran against then-senator obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.i have no illusion.', 'of course you are right.', 'iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.', 'everybody knows that.', 'but our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.', '(crosstalk)clinton: ... senator sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what i said.', 'the question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?', 'i said no.', 'and in fact, in obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.', 'that is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.', '(applause)sanders: no, i think the idea was that president -- then-senator obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.', 'its easier to talk to your friends.', 'its harder to talk to your enemies.', 'i think we should do both.', '(applause)ifill: let me move on.', 'you have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in syria and in libya.', 'more than a million refugees entered europe in 2015. another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day.nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the mediterranean.', 'and there are reports that 10,000 children are missing.if we are leaders in this world, where should the u.s. be on this?', 'what should the united states be doing, secretary clinton?clinton: well, i was pleased that nato announced just this week that theyre going to start doing patrols in the mediterranean, in the aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the european union.and its especially significant that they are working with both turkey and greece in order to do this.with respect to the united states, i think our role in nato, our support for the e.u., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.and we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to turkey and to members of the e.u.', 'in particular.clinton: this is a humanitarian catastrophe.', 'there is no other description of it.', 'so we do as the united states have to support our friends, our allies in europe.', 'we have to stand with them.', 'we have to provide financial support to them.', 'we have to provide the nato support to back up the mission that is going on.', 'and we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.sanders: a couple of years ago, i had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.', 'and i went to one of these turkish refugee camps right on the border of syria.', 'and what a sad sight that was: men, women, children forced out of their homes.', 'and turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.it seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that i very strongly disagree with those republican candidates who say, you know what, weve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.', 'that is not what america is supposed to be about.so i believe that working with europe -- and, by the way, you know, weve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.', 'you got kuwait and you got qatar and you got saudi arabia.', 'they have a responsibility, as well.but i think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis were seeing from syria and afghanistan, as well.', '(applause)woodruff: and we have a final question from our facebook family.', 'and it goes to senator sanders.', 'it comes from robert andrews.', 'hes a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in dover, massachusetts.', 'he says, the world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history.', 'can you name two leaders -- one american and one foreign -- who would influence your foreign policy decisions?', 'and why do you see them as -- why are they influential?sanders: you know, franklin delano roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the american people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.', 'and he stood before the american people and he said, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, a profound statement that gave the american people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.and then what he did is redefine the role of government.', 'you know, you had herbert hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.', 'so what if mass unemployment exists?', 'so what if children are going hungry?', 'thats not the role of the government.and when fdr said, yeah, it is, that were going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.and kind of -- thats what i see our campaign is about right now.', 'in this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the american people dont give up on the political process.', 'dont listen to the trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.', 'if we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.', 'we do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.in the same light, as the foreign leader, winston churchills politics were not my politics.', 'he was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.', 'but nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the british people when they stood virtually alone against the nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.', 'those are two leaders that i admire very much.', '(applause)clinton: i certainly agree with fdr for all the reasons senator sanders said.', 'and i agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.', 'i would choose nelson mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.clinton: but i want to -- i want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today senator sanders said that president obama failed the presidential leadership test.', 'and this is not the first time that he has criticized president obama.', 'in the past he has called him weak.', 'he has called him a disappointment.he wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers remorse when it comes to president obamas leadership and legacy.and i just couldnt agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.', 'you know, from my perspective, maybe because i understand what president obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the republicans in congress, i dont think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...(applause)clinton: ... who got us out of that...(applause)clinton: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.', 'and it is a -- the kind of criticism that weve heard from senator sanders about our president i expect from republicans.', 'i do not expect from someone running for the democratic nomination to succeed president obama.sanders: that is...(applause)sanders: madam secretary, that is a low blow.', 'i have worked with president obama for the last seven years.', 'when president obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.', 'we had a $1.4 trillion deficit.', 'and the worlds financial system is on the verge of collapse.as a result of his efforts and the efforts of joe biden against unprecedented, i was there in the senate, unprecedented republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.', '(applause)sanders: but you know what?', 'last i heard we lived in a democratic society.', 'last i heard, a united states senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.so i have voiced criticisms.', 'youre right.', 'maybe you havent.', 'i have.', 'but i think to suggest that i have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?', 'the blurb said that the next president of the united states has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.thats what i said.', 'that is what i believe.', '(applause)sanders: president obama and i are friends.', 'as you know, he came to vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.', 'i have worked for his re-election.', 'his first election and his re-election.but i think it is really unfair to suggest that i have not been supportive of the president.', 'i have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.', 'do senators have the right to disagree with the president?', 'have you ever disagreed with a president?', 'i suspect you may have.', '(applause)clinton: you know, senator, what i am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what i would rather do, i dont agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, i think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.as a senator, yes, i was a senator.', 'i understand we can disagree on the path forward.', 'but those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that i find particularly troubling.ifill: senator, if you would like respond to -- you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.sanders: well, one of us ran against barack obama.', 'i was not that candidate.', '(applause)sanders: all right, look, this has been a great debate.', 'a lot of interesting issues have come together.', 'let me conclude by just saying this.there is no president, in my view, not hillary clinton, not bernie sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on wall street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.this campaign is not just about electing a president.', 'what this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they dont think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, its like going to the moon.', 'it aint going to happen.', 'low income people who are not involved in the political process.sanders: what this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.thank you all very much.', '(applause)woodruff: secretary clinton?clinton: you know, we -- we agree that weve got to get unaccountable money out of politics.', 'we agree that wall street should never be allowed to wreck main street again.but heres the point i want to make tonight.', 'i am not a single- issue candidate, and i do not believe we live in a single-issue country.', 'i think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether its poison in the water of the children of flint, or whether its the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other american today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the lgbt community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, thats what i want to take on.and here in wisconsin, i want to reiterate: weve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...(applause)... the american middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.', 'yes, does wall street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?', 'youre right.but if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in flint.', 'we would still have racism holding people back.', 'we would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.', 'we would still have lgbt people who get married on saturday and get fired on monday.', 'and we would still have governors like scott walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.', 'so im going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of americans fulfilling their potential, because i dont think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single american to live up to theirs.', '(applause)ifill: thank you.', 'thank you senator clinton.', 'thank you, senator sanders.', 'we also want to thank our partners at facebook and our hosts here at the university of wisconsin, milwaukee.', '(applause)woodruff: and we want to thank our audience, our quiet audience here in helen bader concert hall,

private communications with senior russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.the activities of trump adviser carter page, who has extensive business interests in russia, have been discussed with senior members of congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said.', 'after one of those briefings, senate minority leader harry reid wrote fbi director james comey, citing reports of meetings between a trump adviser (a reference to page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the trump campaign and the kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.some of those briefed were “taken aback” when they learned about page’s contacts in moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the russians that could undercut u.s. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.', 'the source added that u.s. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser’s talks with senior russian officials close to president vladimir putin were being “actively monitored and investigated.”a senior u.s. law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by yahoo news.', '“it’s on our radar screen,” said the official about page’s contacts with russian officials.', '“it’s being looked at.”page is a former merrill lynch investment banker in moscow who now runs a new york consulting firm, global energy capital, located around the corner from trump tower, that specializes in oil and gas deals in russia and other central asian countries.', 'he declined repeated requests to comment for this story.trump first mentioned page’s name when asked to identify his “foreign policy team” during an interview with the washington post editorial team last march.', 'describing him then only as a “phd,” trump named page as among five advisers “that we are dealing with.” but his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; trump spokeswoman hope hicks last month called him an “informal foreign adviser” who “does not speak for mr. trump or the campaign.” asked this week by yahoo news, trump campaign spokesman jason miller said page “has no role” and added: “we are not aware of any of his activities, past or present.” miller did not respond when asked why trump had previously described page as one of his advisers.the questions about page come amid mounting concerns within the u.s. intelligence community about russian cyberattacks on the democratic national committee and state election databases in arizona and illinois.', 'in a rare public talk this week, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence mike vickers said that the russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the u.s. election and were “beyond the pale.” also, this week, two senior democrats — sen. dianne feinstein, ranking minority member on the senate intelligence committee, and rep. adam schiff, ranking minority member on the house intelligence committee — released a joint statement that went further then what u.s. officials had publicly said about the matter.“based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the u.s. election,” they said.', '“at the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.” they added that “orders for the russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the russian government.”page came to the attention of officials at the u.s. embassy in moscow several years ago when he showed up in the russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of u.s. policy and sympathetic to putin.', '“he was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything moscow did,” said one u.s. official who served in russia at the time.he hasn’t been shy about expressing those views in the u.s. as well.', 'last march, shorty after he was named by trump as one of his advisers, page told bloomberg news he had been an adviser to, and investor in, gazprom, the russian state-owned gas company.', 'he then blamed obama administration sanctions — imposed as a response to the russian annexation of crimea — for driving down the company’s stock.', '“so many people who i know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,” page said in the interview.', '“there’s a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.”page showed up again in moscow in early july, just two weeks before the republican national convention formally nominated trump for president, and once again criticized u.s. policy.', 'speaking at a commencement address for the new economic school, an institution funded in part by major russian oligarchs close to putin, page asserted that “washington and other west capitals” had impeded progress in russia “through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.”at the time, page declined to say whether he was meeting with russian officials during his trip, according to a reuters report.but u.s. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, page met with igor sechin, a longtime putin associate and former russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of rosneft, russian’s leading oil company, a well-placed western intelligence source tells yahoo news.', 'that meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by u.s. officials because the treasury department in august 2014 named sechin to a list of russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful actions in the ukraine.” (the treasury announcement described sechin as “utterly loyal to vladimir putin — a key component to his current standing.” at their alleged meeting, sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with page, the western intelligence source said.u.s.', 'intelligence agencies have also received reports that page met with another top putin aide while in moscow — igor

pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.if the united states passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the un’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.however, it gets worse still.', 'the ‘programme of action’ also allows un ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals

their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to american shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.the conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the programme of action (poa).secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the poa.thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the un.fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with un demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.in other words, the united states government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-second amendment set of demands on the american people.if they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the un will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.this agreement is wildly unconstitutional, and that’s being kind.', 'it violates the second amendment, obviously, by its very nature, but it goes further than that.by requiring that state governments, county governments, and

money from america and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.perhaps, before the un lectures america and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the ‘illicit firearms trade.’un peacekeeper operations are infamous for leaving behind firearms, particularly in the third world.', 'there’s a reason

power plants in ohio and the region, and how, he says, environmental regulation from president barack obama’s administration threatens jobs at those plants, too.', 'this could drive up the cost of electricity for every ohioan, romney said.this debate -- over the cost of electricity, the shift among power plants to natural gas, the environmental and health risks, the role the government should or shouldn’t play -- has been building for years.', 'and after the event, the obama campaign had a response, saying that romney’s position on coal has changed substantially since he was governor of massachusetts.immediately after becoming governor, romney condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people, said an obama campaign news release.the claim was similar to one the obama team made in a radio ad, and obama reelection aides backed it with specific quotes romney made in february, 2003, when romney was the freshly elected governor of massachusetts.the quotes:that plant kills people.', 'this was in reference to the salem harbor power plant, in the boston area.i will not create jobs that kill people.', 'this, too, was made by romney outside the salem harbor plant.the obama campaign also highlighted a romney quote that had no lethal references but was just as strong.', 'it came from a state of massachusetts news releasein which romney said: if the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind.', 'i will always come down on the side of public health.romney made each of these statements during a feb. 6, 2003, showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning salem harbor power station.in 2001, massachusetts passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years.', 'the mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the filthy five plants, including salem harbor.', 'public health and environmental scientists at harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that salem harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.as occurs with similar studies that health authorities cite, local residents and others who wanted to keep the salem harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenue) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling.', 'it turned out that the harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from salem harbor’s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the boston globe and the boston herald.but the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly.', 'the harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with.', 'romney appeared to accept their findings, too.', 'in the above-mentioned news release, the commonwealth of massachusetts quoted romney in the third person on the danger factor:romney said that the salem harbor plant is responsible for 53 premature deaths, 570 emergency room visits and 14,400 asthma attacks each year.', 'he also pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.this was in a news release issued by the governor’s aides, not some radical outside instigator.', 'it was issued under the name of romney, lt. gov.', 'kerry healey and romney’s development chief, douglas foy.', 'according to the boston globe, romney hired foy from the conservation law foundation, or clf, a leading environmental advocacy group in massachusetts.the spat with salem harbor turned into a testy exchange that february day after salem harbor’s then-owner, pacific gas and electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with massachusetts’ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off.', 'romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004. his statements that day show how he felt: that plant kills people.', 'and to those including city officials who argued that this would cost jobs: i will not create jobs that kill people.based on some of the quotes, it might appear that romney was speaking only about that single plant (which a new owner, dominion, is phasing out, after which a subsequent third owner will build a natural gas plant there).', 'that’s what we thought when we began looking into this.', 'it is also what the romney campaign told us in email.so was it accurate for the obama campaign to imply that romney’s words characterized his broader attitude toward coal emissions when he was governor?we kept looking, because people in the environmental community told us it was a valid claim.', 'and the news release under romney’s name suggested it as well.romney spoke of plants, not just a single one, when he pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.still, to give him the benefit of doubt, what if he really just meant the salem harbor plant?', 'wasn’t that plant particularly egregious when compared with coal-fired plants under attack by federal regulators today?no, say environmentalists who include authorities from the clf.their claims are supported by u.s. epa emissions data we verified independently.when he said that ‘this plant kills people,’ he was talking about a plant that produced pollution comparable to the emissions of plants in the midwest, said seth kaplan, vice president for policy and climate advocacy at the conservation foundation.jonathan peress, an environmental and regulatory attorney who works for the clf and was recently chairman of the american bar association’s air quality committee, added in a separate interview with politifact ohio that romney promoted massachusetts air standards that were almost identical to those the u.s. epa wants to enforce -- and that romney now criticizes.the levels of emissions that he was talking about were levels that were virtually identical to what the epa has proposed, kaplan agreed.', 'he was steadfastly standing behind emissions reductions that are the same as those currently attacked.to see if this was accurate -- that the emissions romney decried were similar to or even weaker than those under current attack now by the epa (whose rules romney now attacks) -- we examined the emissions cuts that massachusetts wanted and data on the level of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions at salem harbor and in the midwest.', 'the u.s. epa keeps the information in its extensive clean air markets database.nitrogen oxides react with sunlight to create ozone and smog.', 'sulfur dioxide is tied to particulate matter and is considered particularly dangerous to health, said jonathan walke, a senior attorney with the natural resources defense council action fund.the level of both these substances was multiple times lower at salem harbor, even when romney was trying to force the plant to reduce emissions, than at eastlake in northeast ohio and several other ohio plants we checked.', 'our comparisons included multiple years, including salem harbor in 2003 with ohio plants in 2011. to compensate for differences in electricity output, number of boilers and hours of operation at different power plants, we checked the data for emissions per megawatt-hour.', 'the pattern held.it’s all the same pollution, albeit in higher quantities in ohio, walke said.you might ask why we looked at eastlake.', 'it’s because firstenergy corp. plans to shut down two of that plant’s boilers rather than spend heavily on scrubbers to comply with epa rules.', 'this is one of several coal-burning plants at the heart of the current jobs-versus-pollution debate, although romney did not mention it specifically.it’s important to note that the rules on nitrogen and sulfur are not what is prompting the firstenergy shutdowns.', 'new epa rules on mercury and toxic metals are the cause of planned closures in eastlake.', 'the tougher limits won’t take effect until 2014. the epa aims to cut mercury emissions by 79 percent.but as the massachusetts governor, romney supported mercury reductions in his state, too.', 'in 2004, he signed off on a rule aiming to reduce mercury emissions by 95 percent by 2012. with romney’s name on the letterhead, massachusetts in may, 2004, issued a lengthy set of justifications for the mercury rule.', 'among them:first, [new research] confirms and extends our understanding of mercurys harmful effects on learning, attention and other critical cognitive skills in children.', 'recent studies have found that children exposed to mercury levels may show signs of attention deficit disorder, impaired visual-spatial skills and poor coordination.romney was a champion of those mercury regulations, said shanna cleveland, a staff attorney with the conservation law foundation.', 'he was one of the reasons we got them through.time to clean up: romney was discussing a specific power plant, salem harbor, when he said, that plant kills people.', 'but the public record shows that his comments were part of a broad emissions-cutting program he embraced.and the power plant that he considered deadly had emissions that were no worse, and in many

this is who donald trump is.', 'but it’s not only women, and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, african- americans, latinos, people with disabilities, pows, muslims, and so many others.so this is who donald trump is.', 'and the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.', 'that’s why — to go back to your question — i want to send a message — we all should — to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that america already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.clinton: these are very important values to me, because this is the america that i know and love.', 'and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if i’m so fortunate enough to become your president.raddatz: and we want to get to some questions from online…trump: am i allowed to respond to that?', 'i assume i am.raddatz: yes, you can respond to that.trump: it’s just words, folks.', 'it’s just words.', 'those words, i’ve been hearing them for many years.', 'i heard them when they were running for the senate in new york, where hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate new york and she failed.i’ve heard them where hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.', 'i’m going to help the african-americans.', 'i’m going to help the latinos, hispanics.', 'i am going to help the inner cities.she’s done a terrible job for the african-americans.', 'she wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.', 'we saw that firsthand when she was united states senator.', 'she campaigned where the primary part of her campaign…raddatz: mr. trump, mr. trump — i want to get to audience questions and online questions.trump: so, she’s allowed to do that, but i’m not allowed to respond?raddatz: you’re going to have — you’re going to get to respond right now.trump: sounds fair.raddatz: this tape is generating intense interest.', 'in just 48 hours, it’s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.', 'as we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.', 'jeff from ohio asks on facebook, “trump says the campaign has changed him.', 'when did that happen?” so, mr. trump, let me add to that.', 'when you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?', 'and you have two minutes for this.trump: it was locker room talk, as i told you.', 'that was locker room talk.', 'i’m not proud of it.', 'i am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.', 'and certainly, i’m not proud of it.', 'but that was something that happened.if you look at bill clinton, far worse.', 'mine are words, and his was action.', 'his was what he’s done to women.', 'there’s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women.', 'so you can say any way you want to say it, but bill clinton was abusive to women.hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.', 'four of them here tonight.', 'one of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. her client she represented got him off, and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.', 'kathy shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.so don’t tell me about words.', 'i am absolutely — i apologize for those words.', 'but it is things that people say.', 'but what president clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.', 'he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.', 'paula jones, who’s also here tonight.and i will tell you that when hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that i said 11 years ago, i think it’s disgraceful, and i think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.', '(applause)raddatz: can we please hold the applause?', 'secretary clinton, you have two minutes.clinton: well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he’s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.', 'he gets to decide what he wants to talk about.', 'instead of answering people’s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that’s his choice.when i hear something like that, i am reminded of what my friend, michelle obama, advised us all: when they go low, you go high.', '(applause) and, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he’s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.', 'but he never apologizes for anything to anyone.clinton: he never apologized to mr. and mrs. khan, the gold star family whose son, captain khan, died in the line of duty in iraq.', 'and donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.he never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in indiana, but donald said he couldn’t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, “mexican.”he never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.', 'and he never apologized for the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states of america.', 'he owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.trump: well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, sidney blumenthal — he’s another real winner that you have — and he’s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.', 'so you really owe him an apology.', 'you’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with president obama in a certain garb.', 'that was long before i was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.number two, michelle obama.', 'i’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.', 'and i’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials i’ve ever seen of michelle obama talking about you, hillary.so, you talk about friend?', 'go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the bernie sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.', 'and all you have to do is take a look at wikileaks and just see what they say about bernie sanders and see what deborah wasserman schultz had in mind, because bernie sanders, between super-delegates and deborah wasserman schultz, he never had a chance.', 'and i was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.but when you talk about apology, i think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.and i’ll tell you what.', 'i didn’t think i’d say this, but i’m going to say it, and i hate to say it.', 'but if i win, i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.', 'there has never been anything like it, and we’re going to have a special prosecutor.when i speak, i go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.', 'in my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the fbi are furious.', 'there has never been anything like this, where e-mails — and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.so we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it, because you know what?', 'people have been — their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you’ve done.', 'and it’s a disgrace.', 'and honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.raddatz: secretary clinton, i want to follow up on that.', '(crosstalk)raddatz: i’m going to let you talk about e-mails.clinton: … because everything he just said is absolutely false, but i’m not surprised.trump: oh, really?clinton: in the first debate…(laughter)raddatz: and really, the audience needs to calm down here.clinton: … i told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking donald all the time.', 'i’d never get to talk about anything i want to do and how we’re going to really make lives better for people.so, once again, go to hillaryclinton.com.', 'we have literally trump — you can fact check him in real time.', 'last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so i expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is — it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country.trump: because you’d be in jail.', '(applause)raddatz: secretary clinton…cooper: we want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.', 'please do not applaud.', 'you’re just wasting time.raddatz: and, secretary clinton, i do want to follow up on e- mails.', 'you’ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.', 'you disagreed with fbi director james comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, “extremely careless.” the fbi said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.', 'you don’t call that extremely careless?', 'clinton: well, martha, first, let me say — and i’ve said before, but i’ll repeat it, because i want everyone to hear it — that was a mistake, and i take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.', 'obviously, if i were to do it over again, i would not.', 'i’m not making any excuses.', 'it was a mistake.', 'and i am very sorry about that.but i think it’s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.', 'after a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server i was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all — anyone who says otherwise has no basis — that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.i take classified materials very seriously and always have.', 'when i was on the senate armed services committee, i was privy to a lot of classified material.', 'obviously, as secretary of state, i had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin laden.', 'so i am very committed to taking classified information seriously.', 'and as i said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.raddatz: ok, we’re going to move on.trump: and yet she didn’t know the word — the letter c on a document.', 'right?', 'she didn’t even know what that word — what that letter meant.you know, it’s amazing.', 'i’m watching hillary go over facts.', 'and she’s going after fact after fact, and she’s lying again, because she said she — you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.', 'you think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?', 'i don’t think so.she said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class.', 'well, maybe we’ll give three or three or four or five or something.', '33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she’s saying there wasn’t anything wrong.and more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.', 'that wasn’t before.', 'that was after.', 'she got it from the united states congress.', 'and i’ll be honest, i am so disappointed in congressmen, including republicans, for allowing this to happen.our justice department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.', 'but for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.', 'what you did — and this is after getting a subpoena from the united states congress.cooper: we have to move on.trump: you did that.', 'wait a minute.', 'one second.cooper: secretary clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.raddatz: we want to give the audience a chance.trump: if you did that in the private sector, you’d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the united states congress.cooper: secretary clinton, you can respond.', 'then we have to move on to an audience question.clinton: look, it’s just not true.', 'and so please, go to…trump: oh, you didn’t delete them?cooper: allow her to respond, please.clinton: it was personal e-mails, not official.trump: oh, 33,000?', 'yeah.clinton: not — well, we turned over 35,000, so…trump: oh, yeah.', 'what about the other 15,000?cooper: please allow her to respond.', 'she didn’t talk while you talked.clinton: yes, that’s true, i didn’t.trump: because you have nothing to say.clinton: i didn’t in the first debate, and i’m going to try not to in this debate, because i’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.trump: get off this question.clinton: ok, donald.', 'i know you’re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way republicans are leaving you.', 'but let’s at least focus…trump: let’s see what happens…(crosstalk)cooper: allow her to respond.clinton: … on some of the issues that people care about tonight.', 'let’s get to their questions.cooper: we have a question here from ken karpowicz.', 'he has a question about health care.', 'ken?trump: i’d like to know, anderson, why aren’t you bringing up the e-mails?', 'i’d like to know.', 'why aren’t you bringing…cooper: we brought up the e-mails.trump: no, it hasn’t.', 'it hasn’t.', 'and it hasn’t been finished at all.cooper: ken karpowicz has a question.trump: it’s nice to — one on three.question: thank you.', 'affordable care act, known as obamacare, it is not affordable.', 'premiums have gone up.', 'deductibles have gone up.', 'copays have gone up.', 'prescriptions have gone up.', 'and the coverage has gone down.', 'what will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?cooper: that first one goes to secretary clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.clinton: if he wants to start, he can start.', 'no, go ahead, donald.trump: no, i’m a gentlemen, hillary.', 'go ahead.', '(laughter)cooper: secretary clinton?clinton: well, i think donald was about to say he’s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the affordable care act.', 'and i’m going to fix it, because i agree with you.', 'premiums have gotten too high.', 'copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and i’ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.but here’s what i don’t want people to forget when we’re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the affordable care act passed, it wasn’t just that 20 million got insurance who didn’t have it before.', 'but that in and of itself was a good thing.', 'i meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.but everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.', 'number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.', 'number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.number three, women can’t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the affordable care act.', 'number four, if you’re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn’t happen before.so i want very much to save what works and is good about the affordable care act.', 'but we’ve got to get costs down.', 'we’ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.', 'but if we repeal it, as donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits i just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.', 'and then we would have to start all over again.right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.', 'that’s the highest we’ve ever been in our country.', 'cooper: secretary clinton, your time is up.clinton: so i want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.cooper: mr. trump, you have two minutes.trump: it is such a great question and it’s maybe the question i get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.', 'obamacare is a disaster.', 'you know it.', 'we all know it.', 'it’s going up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen worldwide.', 'nobody’s ever seen numbers like this for health care.it’s only getting worse.', 'in ’17, it implodes by itself.', 'their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more money, more and more money.', 'we have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.obamacare will never work.', 'it’s very bad, very bad health insurance.', 'far too expensive.', 'and not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.', 'it’s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.we have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.', 'we have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want — and president obama and whoever was working on it — they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.', 'we want competition.you will have the finest health care plan there is.', 'she wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to canada.', 'and if you haven’t noticed the canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the united states in many cases because their system is so slow.', 'it’s catastrophic in certain ways.but she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.', 'hillary clinton has been after this for years.', 'obamacare was the first step.', 'obamacare is a total disaster.', 'and not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody’s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you’re never going to be able to use it.cooper: mr. trump, your time…trump: it is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.cooper: secretary clinton, let me follow up with you.', 'your husband called obamacare, quote, “the craziest thing in the world,” saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half.', 'was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?clinton: no, i mean, he clarified what he meant.', 'and it’s very clear.', 'look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.', 'but we have an employer-based system.', 'that’s where the vast majority of people get their health care.and the affordable care act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on medicaid.', 'obviously, medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn’t have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.that was the slot that the obamacare approach was to take.', 'and like i say, 20 million people now have health insurance.', 'so if we just rip it up and throw it away, what donald’s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies…cooper: secretary clinton…clinton: … get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, i’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma…cooper: your time is up.clinton: … you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it.', 'so let’s fix what’s broken about it, but let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.', 'that’s not going to work.cooper: mr. trump, let me follow up on this.', 'trump: well, i just want — just one thing.', 'first of all, hillary, everything’s broken about it.', 'everything.', 'number two, bernie sanders said that hillary clinton has very bad judgment.', 'this is a perfect example of it, trying to save obamacare, which is a disaster.cooper: you’ve said you want to end obamacare…trump: by the way…cooper: you’ve said you want to end obamacare.', 'you’ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.', 'how do you force insurance companies to do that if you’re no longer mandating that every american get insurance?trump: we’re going to be able to.', 'you’re going to have plans…cooper: what does that mean?trump: well, i’ll tell you what it means.', 'you’re going to have plans that are so good, because we’re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.', 'once we break out — once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come…cooper: are you going — are you going to have a mandate that americans have to have health insurance?trump: president obama — anderson, excuse me.', 'president obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.', 'you know that, because jonathan gruber, the architect of obamacare, was said — he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.', 'president obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.', 'the whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn’t work.but when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we’ll also be able to help people that can’t get — don’t have money because we are going to have people protected.and republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.', 'we’re going to block grant into the states.', 'we’re going to block grant into medicaid into the states…cooper: thank you, mr. trump.trump: … so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.cooper: thank you, mr. trump.raddatz: we now go to gorbah hamed with a question for both candidates.question: hi.', 'there are 3.3 million muslims in the united states, and i’m one of them.', 'you’ve mentioned working with muslim nations, but with islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?raddatz: mr. trump, you’re first.trump: well, you’re right about islamophobia, and that’s a shame.', 'but one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that — because there is a problem.', 'i mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.', 'and we have to be sure that muslims come in and report when they see something going on.', 'when they see hatred going on, they have to report it.as an example, in san bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.', 'horribly wounded.', 'they’ll never be the same.', 'muslims have to report the problems when they see them.and, you know, there’s always a reason for everything.', 'if they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center.', 'go outside.', 'look at paris.', 'look at that horrible — these are radical islamic terrorists.and she won’t even mention the word and nor will president obama.', 'he won’t use the term “radical islamic terrorism.” now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.', 'she won’t say the name and president obama won’t say the name.', 'but the name is there.', 'it’s radical islamic terror.', 'and before you solve it, you have to say the name.raddatz: secretary clinton?', 'clinton: well, thank you for asking your question.', 'and i’ve heard this question from a lot of muslim-americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about muslims.', 'and even someone like captain khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the united states army, has been subject to attack by donald.i want to say just a couple of things.', 'first, we’ve had muslims in america since george washington.', 'and we’ve had many successful muslims.', 'we just lost a particular well-known one with muhammad ali.clinton: my vision of america is an america where everyone has a place, if you’re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.', 'that’s what america is.', 'that’s what we want america to be for our children and our grandchildren.it’s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that donald has about muslims.', 'we need american muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.', 'i’ve worked with a lot of different muslim groups around america.', 'i’ve met with a lot of them, and i’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that’s what i want to see.it’s also important i intend to defeat isis, to do so in a coalition with majority muslim nations.', 'right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the americans?', 'and this is a gift to isis and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.we are not at war with islam.', 'and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.', 'so i want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.raddatz: thank you, secretary clinton.mr.', 'trump, in december, you said this.', '“donald j. trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.', 'we have no choice.', 'we have no choice.” your running mate said this week that the muslim ban is no longer your position.', 'is that correct?', 'and if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?trump: first of all, captain khan is an american hero, and if i were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, i would not have had our people in iraq.', 'iraq was disaster.', 'so he would have been alive today.the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.', 'hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands — excuse me.', 'excuse me..raddatz: and why did it morph into that?', 'no, did you — no, answer the question.', 'do you still believe… trump: why don’t you interrupt her?', 'you interrupt me all the time.raddatz: i do.trump: why don’t you interrupt her?raddatz: would you please explain whether or not the muslim ban still stands?trump: it’s called extreme vetting.', 'we are going to areas like syria where they’re coming in by the tens of thousands because of barack obama.', 'and hillary clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over obama.', 'people are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.', 'this is going to be the great trojan horse of all time.we have enough problems in this country.', 'i believe in building safe zones.', 'i believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.', 'but i don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from syria when we know nothing about them.', 'we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.raddatz: and, secretary clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 syrian refugees.', 'we know you want tougher vetting.', 'that’s not a perfect system.', 'so why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?clinton: well, first of all, i will not let anyone into our country that i think poses a risk to us.', 'but there are a lot of refugees, women and children — think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the russian and syrian air forces.there are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, i believe, because of russian aggression.', 'and we need to do our part.', 'we by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that europe and others are.', 'but we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.but it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion.', 'how do you do that?', 'we are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.', 'how do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?', 'are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?', 'and how do we expect to be able to implement those?so i thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.', 'and indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.and the final thing i would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he’s denied being for the war in iraq.', 'we have it on tape.', 'the entire press corps has looked at it.', 'it’s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.trump: that’s not been debunked.clinton: so, please…trump: that has not been

would do that as president.i think wherever we can cooperate with russia, that’s fine.', 'and i did as secretary of state.', 'that’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.', 'it’s how we got

basically has fallen.', 'let me tell you something.', 'you take a look at mosul.', 'the biggest problem i have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have mosul.', 'they think a lot of the isis

leaving mosul.', 'why can’t they do it quietly?', 'why can’t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the american public that we’ve knocked out the leaders,

help get civilians out.trump: and we have general flynn.', 'and we have — look, i have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.', 'i have 21 congressional medal of honor recipients who endorsed

leadership, goes in to fight mosul.now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can’t believe it.', 'all i say is this.', 'general george patton, general douglas macarthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we’re doing in the middle east.raddatz: i’m going to go to secretary clinton.', 'secretary clinton, you want assad to go.', 'you advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for aleppo.', 'you talk about diplomatic efforts.', 'those have failed.', 'cease-fires have failed.', 'would you introduce the threat of u.s. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the assad regime to back up diplomacy?clinton: i would not use american ground forces in syria.', 'i think that would be a very serious mistake.', 'i don’t think american troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.', 'i don’t think that is a smart strategy.i do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so i do support what is happening, but let me just…raddatz: but what would you do differently than president obama is doing?clinton: well, martha, i hope that by the time i — if i’m fortunate…trump: everything.clinton: i hope by the time i am president that we will have pushed isis out of iraq.', 'i do think

baghdadi.', 'i would specifically target baghdadi, because i think our targeting of al qaida leaders — and i was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones — made a difference.',

are up against.because i think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.', 'and so i would want to see the supreme court reverse citizens united and get dark, unaccountable money out of our

can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.', 'i want a supreme court that will stick with roe v. wade and a woman’s right to choose, and i want a supreme court that will stick with marriage equality.now, donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.', 'and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse roe v. wade and reverse marriage equality.', 'i think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.i want a supreme court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests.', 'i want a supreme court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.so i have very clear views about what i want to see to kind of change the balance on the supreme court.', 'and i regret deeply that the senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that president obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine supreme court justices.', 'i think that was a dereliction of duty.i hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if i am so fortunate enough as to be president, i will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine

steelworkers and our steel companies.', 'we have to guard our energy companies.', 'we have to make it possible.the epa is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.',

in the energy business.', 'it’s a disgrace.cooper: your time is up.', 'thank you.trump: it’s an absolute disgrace.', 'cooper: secretary clinton, two minutes.clinton: and actually — well, that was very interesting.', 'first of all, china is illegally dumping steel in the united states and donald trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and american steel plants out of business.', 'that’s something that i fought against as a senator and that i would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don’t get taken advantage of by china on steel or anything else.you know, because it sounds like you’re in the business or you’re aware of people in the business — you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.', 'we are not dependent upon the middle east.', 'but the middle east still controls a lot of the prices.', 'so the price of oil has been way down.', 'and that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?', 'we are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.', 'and i think that’s an important transition.we’ve got to remain energy-independent.', 'it gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle east.', 'we have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.so i have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because i think that is a serious problem.', 'and i support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because i think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.but i also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind.', 'that’s why i’m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.', 'a lot of them lost their lives.', 'they were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.', 'i don’t want to walk away from them.', 'so we’ve got to do something for them.cooper: secretary

make here at home and around the world, from the supreme court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.', 'it’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had.and that’s why i’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is i want to do as president.', 'and that’s why i hope people will check on that for

days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that senator obamas campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on nafta have been very disturbing to me.and therefore, i think its important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision.you know, for example, its been unfortunate that senator obama has consistently said that i would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not.',

can set aside.i do want to focus on the issue of health care because senator clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate.', 'now, keep in mind that i have consistently said that senator clintons got a good health care plan.', 'i think i have a good health care plan.', 'i think mine is better, but i have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar.i have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from senator clinton in iowa, in nevada and other places suggesting that i want to leave 15 million people out.according to senator clinton, that is accurate.', 'i dispute it, and i think it is inaccurate.', 'on the other hand, i dont fault senator clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan.the reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate.', 'that is not a mandate for the government to provide coverage to everybody; it is a mandate that every individual purchase health care.and the mailing that we put out accurately indicates that the main difference between senator clintons plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care.advertisement continue reading the main storyif it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as theyve done in massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out.', 'and if thats the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate.now, senator clinton has not indicated how she would enforce this mandate.', 'she hasnt indicated what level of subsidy she would provide to assure that it was, in fact, affordable.', 'and so it is entirely legitimate for us to point out these differences.but i think its very important to understand the context of this, and that is that senator clinton has -- her campaign, at least -- has constantly sent out negative attacks on us, e-mail, robocalls, flyers, television ads, radio calls.and, you know, we havent whined about it because i understand thats the nature of these campaigns, but to suggest somehow that our mailing is somehow different from the kinds of approaches that senator clinton has taken throughout this campaign i think is simply not accurate.mr.', 'williams: and senator clinton, on this subject --sen. clinton: but i have to -- i have to respond to that because this is not just any issue, and certainly weve had a vigorous back and forth on both sides of our

person.senator obama has a mandate in his plan.', 'its a mandate on parents to provide health insurance for their children.', 'thats about 150 million people who would be required to do that.', 'the difference between senator obama and myself is that i know, from the work ive done on health care for many years, that if everyones not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do whats called cherry picking -- pick those who get insurance and leave others out.we will continue to have a hidden tax, so that when someone goes to the emergency room without insurance -- 15 million or however many -- that amount of money that will be used to take care of that person will be then spread among all the rest of us.and most importantly, you know, the kind of attack on my health care plan, which the university of pennsylvania and others have said is misleading -- that attack goes right to the heart of whether or not we will be able to achieve universal health care.', 'thats a core democratic party value.', 'its something that ever since harry truman we have stood for.advertisement continue reading the main storyand what i find regrettable is that in senator obamas mailing that he has sent out across ohio, it is almost as though the health insurance companies and the republicans wrote it, because in my plan there is enough money, according to the independent experts whove evaluated it, to provide the kind of subsidies so that everyone would be able to afford it.', 'it is not the same as a single state trying to do this, because the federal government has many more resources at its disposal.sen.', 'obama (?', '): (inaudible.)sen.', 'clinton: so i think its imperative that we stand as democrats for universal health care.', 'ive staked out a claim for that.',

clinton.', 'and this is -- this is, i think, the point of the debate, is that senator clinton repeatedly claims that i dont stand for universal health care.', 'and, you know, for senator clinton to say that, i think, is simply not accurate.every expert has said that anybody who wants health care under my plan will be able to obtain it.', 'president clintons own secretary of labor has said that my plan does more to reduce costs and as a consequence makes sure that the people who need health care right now all across ohio, all across texas, rhode island, vermont, all across america, will be able to obtain it.', 'and we do more to reduce costs than any other plan thats been out there.now, i have no objection to senator clinton thinking that her approach is superior, but the fact of the matter is, is that if, as weve heard tonight, we still dont know how senator clinton intends to enforce a mandate, and if we dont know the level of subsidies that shes going to provide, then you can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still cant afford it, even with the subsidies.and they are then worse off.', 'they then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that.mr.', 'williams: thank you.sen.', 'obama: that is a genuine difference between myself and senator clinton.and the last point i would make is, the insurance companies actually are happy to have a mandate.', 'the insurance companies dont mind making sure that

case.if you have a mandate, it has to be enforceable.', 'so theres no difference here.sen.', 'obama: no, there is a difference.sen.', 'clinton: its just that i know that parents who get sick have

would be as though franklin roosevelt said lets make social security voluntary -- thats -- you know, thats -- lets let everybody get in it if they can afford it -- or if president johnson said lets make medicare voluntary.sen.', 'obama: well, let me --sen. clinton: what we have said is that at the point of employment, at the point of contact with various government agencies, we would have people signed up.', 'its like when you get a 401(k), its your employer.', 'the employer automatically enrolls you.', 'you would be enrolled.and under my plan, it is affordable because, number one, we have enough money in our plan.', 'a comparison of the plans like the ones were proposing found that actually i would cover nearly everybody at a much lower cost than senator obamas plan because we would not only provide these health care tax credits, but i would limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for a premium to a low percentage of your income.', 'so it will be affordable.now, if you want to say that we shouldnt try to get everyone into health insurance, thats a big difference, because i believe if we dont have universal health care, we will never provide

are many experts who have concluded that she does not.i do provide a mandate for children, because, number one, we have created a number of programs in which we can have greater assurance that those children will be covered at an affordable price.', 'on the -- on the point of many adults, we dont want to put in a situation in which, on the front end, we are mandating them, we are forcing them to purchase insurance, and if the subsidies are inadequate, the burden is on them, and they will be penalized.', 'and that is what senator clintons plan does.now, i am -- i am happy to have a discussion with senator clinton about how we can both achieve the goal of universal health care.', 'what i do not accept -- and which is what senator clinton has consistently done and in fact the same experts she cites basically say theres no real difference between our plans, that are -- that they are not substantial.but it has to do with how we are going to achieve universal health care.', 'that is an area where i believe that if we make it affordable, people will purchase it.', 'in fact, medicare part b is not mandated, it is voluntary.', 'and yet people over 65 choose to purchase it, hillary, and

for six years of my first term i have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president i will have a lot more tools at my disposal.', 'and the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- i mean, this is not a big leap.', 'twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the clinton administration under my husband.', 'we can create at least 5 million new jobs.im not just talking about it.', 'i helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs.', 'i want to see people throughout ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and i know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the democrats wanted, as i originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those.you know, take a country like germany.', 'they made a big bet on solar power.', 'they have a smaller economy and population than ours.theyve created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that cant be outsourced.', 'these are jobs that have to be done in youngstown, in dayton, in cincinnati.', 'these are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through.', 'so i do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years.mr.', 'russert: brian?mr.', 'williams: senator obama, yesterday senator clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and im going to read you a quote from it.', 'quote, weve seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security.', 'we cannot let that happen again.', 'america has already taken that chance one time too many.', 'some of the comments in the speech were more pointed.', 'the senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of george w. bush at the same period.', 'provided you could be going into a general election against a republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair?sen.', 'obama: well, senator clinton i think equates experience with longevity in washington.', 'i dont think the american people do and i dont think that if you look at the judgments that weve made over the last several years that thats the accurate measure.', 'on the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into iraq -- i was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-american sentiment -- that it would distract us from afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and i do not believe it has made us more safe.al qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that john mccain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both senator clinton and i are talking about.', 'so on pakistan, during the summer i suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern pakistan.advertisement continue reading the main storyand many people said at the time well, you cant target those terrorists because musharraf is our ally and we dont want to offend him.', 'in fact, what we had was neither stability in pakistan nor democracy in pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in pakistan we would be much further along now than we are.', 'so on the critical issues that actually matter i believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that i think has been superior to senator clintons as well as senator mccains.mr.', 'williams: well, senator clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not senator obama was qualified to be commander in chief.', 'is your contention in this latest speech that america would somehow be taking a chance on senator obama as commander in chief?sen.', 'clinton: well, i have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in northern ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to beijing and standing up for womens rights as human rights and so much else.', 'and every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, senator obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. hes to be commended for having given the speech.', 'many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didnt have responsibility, he didnt have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way george bush was conducting the war.', 'and when he came to the senate, he and i have voted exactly the same.', 'we have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently.', 'so the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasnt just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference?', 'where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war?and on a number of other issues, i just believe that, you know, as senator obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan, which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take.', 'i have long advocated a much tougher approach to musharraf and to pakistan, and have pushed the white house to do that.and i disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it.so i think youve got to look at, you know, what i have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the senate armed services committee for now five years.', 'and i think that, you know, standing on that stage with senator mccain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, i will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really america must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country.mr.', 'williams: senator obama, a quick response.sen.', 'obama: let me just follow up.', 'my objections to the war in iraq were simply -- not simply a speech.', 'i was in the midst of a u.s. senate campaign.', 'it was a high-stakes campaign.', 'i was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and i was very specific as to why.and so when i bring this up, it is not simply to say i told you so, but it is to give you an insight in terms of how i would make decisions.advertisement continue reading the main storyand the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder.', 'it was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then weve voted the same way.', 'once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out.', 'the question is, whos making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch?', 'and the fact is that senator clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to george bush on day one on this critical issue.', 'so the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we cant afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the united states of america.with respect to pakistan, i never said i would bomb pakistan.', 'what i said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin laden or other key al qaeda officials, and we -- and pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should.', 'and just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al qaeda official.that is the position that we should have taken in the first place.', 'and president musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we dont know how the new legislature in pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy.and so my claim is not simply based on a speech.', 'it is based on the judgments that ive displayed during the course of my service on the senate foreign relations committee, while ive been in the united states senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, i think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against bush and cheney.', 'and that is how were going to be able to debate john mccain.', 'having a debate with john mccain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, i think, does not put you in a strong position.tim russert.sen.', 'clinton: well, i guess that --mr. russert: let me talk about the future -- let me talk the future about iraq, because this is important, i think, to democratic voters particularly.', 'you both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from iraq.', 'you both have said youd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al qaeda, to neutralize iran.', 'if the iraqi government said, president clinton or president obama, youre pulling out your troops this quickly?youre going to be gone in a year, but youre going to leave a residual force behind?', 'no.', 'get out.', 'get out now.', 'if you dont want to stay and protect us, were a sovereign nation.', 'go home now.', 'will you leave?sen.', 'obama: well, if the iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there.', 'this is a sovereign government, as george bush continually reminds us.now, i think that we can be in a partnership with iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of iraqis and to meet our national security interests.but in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why i have said that as soon as i take office, i will call in the joint chiefs of staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in.', 'we will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed.', 'we will provide them continued support.', 'but it is important for us not to be held hostage by the iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, thats distracting us from afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in america that will make us more competitive and more safe.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, if the iraqis said im sorry, were not happy with this arrangement; if youre not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'and i believe that there is no military solution that the americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the iraqi government.', 'and --mr. russert: let me ask -- let me ask you this, senator.', 'i want to ask you --sen. clinton: and they need to take responsibility for themselves.', 'and --mr. russert: i want to ask both of you this question, then.', 'if we -- if this scenario plays out and the americans get out in total and al qaeda resurges and iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as american president, to re-invade, to go back into iraq to stabilize it?sen.', 'clinton: you know, tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals.', 'and i believe that whats --mr. russert: but this is reality.sen.', 'clinton: no -- well, it isnt reality.', 'youre -- youre -- youre making lots of different hypothetical assessments.i believe that it is in americas interests and in the interests of the iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal.', 'ive been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and ive been pushing them to actually do it.', 'ive also said that i would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that i asked begun to be put together as soon as i became president.and i think we can take out one to two brigades a month.', 'ive also been a leader in trying to prevent president bush from getting us committed to staying in iraq regardless for as long as senator mccain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.so, when you talk about what we need to do in iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of america.', 'and i believe this is in the best interest.but i also have heard senator obama refer continually to afghanistan, and he references being on the foreign relations committee.', 'he chairs the subcommittee on europe.', 'it has jurisdiction over nato.', 'nato is critical to our mission in afghanistan.', 'hes held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato in afghanistan.you have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, i want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee.', 'but also, do you reserve a right as american president to go back into iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?sen.', 'obama: well, first of all, i became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. so it is true that we havent had oversight hearings on afghanistan.newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.', 'invalid email address.', 'please

allies to put more troops into afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in iraq and i think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in afghanistan in part because of whats happened in iraq.now, i always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, i will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for american interests.', 'and if al qaeda is forming a base in iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the american homeland and our interests abroad.', 'so that is true, i think, not just in iraq, but thats true in other places.', 'thats part of my argument with respect to pakistan.i think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in making sure that we are rooting out terrorist organizations, but if they are planning attacks on americans, like what happened in 9/11, it is my job -- it will be my job as president to make sure that we are hunting them down.mr.', 'williams: and senator, i need to reserve --sen. clinton: well, but i have -- i just have to add --mr. williams: im sorry, senator, ive got to --sen. clinton: now wait a minute, i have to add --mr. williams: ive got to get us to a break because television doesnt stop.sen.', 'clinton: -- because the question -- the question was about invading -- invading -- iraq.mr.',

-- (laughter, applause) -- of all the charges and countercharges made tonight, we can confirm that is not you, senator obama.sen.', 'obama: (chuckles.)mr.', 'williams: that was senator clinton.', 'but since we played that tape, albeit in error, for this segment, how did you take that?sen.', 'clinton: (laughs.)(laughter.)mr.', 'williams: how did you take those remarks when you heard them?sen.', 'obama: well, i thought senator clinton showed some good humor there.', 'i would give her points for delivery.sen.', 'clinton: (laughs.)(laughter.)sen.', 'obama: look, i understand the broader point that senator clintons been trying to make over the last several weeks.', 'you know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action.', 'and as i said in the last debate, ive spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and theyre seeking out the american dream.', 'thats how i started my career in public service, thats how i brought democrats and republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, thats how i helped to reform a welfare system that wasnt working in illinois, thats how ive provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so im very proud of that track record.and if senator clinton thinks that its all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at walter reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before i got to the senate.', 'and i changed that law.', 'or talk to those folks who i think have recognized that special interests are dominating washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in ohio.and so when i pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists cant get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of congress and they have to disclose who theyre getting money from and who theyre bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families.just one point ill make, i was in cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one.', 'and these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they dont have health care.', 'one of them doesnt have a job.', 'one of them is looking after an aging parent.', 'two of them were looking after disabled children.', 'one of them was dipping into their retirement accounts because she had been put on disability on the job.', 'and you hear these stories and what you realize is nobody has been listening to them.', 'that is not who george bush or dick cheney has been advocating for over the last seven years.and so i am not interested in talk.', 'i am not interested in speeches.', 'i would not be running if i wasnt absolutely convinced that i can put an economic agenda forward that is going to provide them with health care, is going to make college more affordable, and is going to get them the kinds of help that they need not to solve all their problems, but at least to be able to achieve the american dream.mr.', 'williams: well, let me ask you, senator clinton: what did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, i was having a little fun.', 'you know, its hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.but the larger point is that i know trying to get health insurance for every american thats affordable will not be easy.', 'its not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody its the right thing to do.', 'you know, 15 years ago i tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and i know it takes a fighter.', 'it takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests.you know, i have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies.', 'these have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the white house did, but because members of congress went along.', 'and i want to get that money back and invest it in the american middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout ohio, because what i hear as i go from toledo to parma to cleveland to, you know, dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but theyre not getting ahead.', 'they feel like theyre invisible to their government.', 'so when it came time to vote on dick cheneys energy bill, i voted no, and senator obama voted yes.', 'when it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which i think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- i voted yes and senator obama voted no.mr.', 'williams: and senator -- senator --sen. clinton: so part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight.', 'and i believe that i am a fighter, and i will fight for the people of ohio and the people of america.mr.', 'williams: what i was attempting to do here is to show something senator obama said about you, and im told its ready.mr.', 'russert: lets try it.mr.', 'williams: lets try it.', 'hang on.', 'watch your monitor.lets try it.', 'were going to come back to you.sen.', 'obama: but im going to have an opportunity to respond to this.sen.', 'obama: (from videotape.)', '-- herself as co-president during the clinton years.', 'every good thing that happened she says she was a part of.', 'and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.mr.', 'williams: now, senator obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but ive been wanting to ask you about this assertion that senator clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president.sen.', 'obama: well, i think what is absolutely true is, is that when senator clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, heres what i did.heres what we did.', 'heres what we accomplished -- which is fine.and i have not -- i have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and i dont begrudge her claiming that as experience.', 'what ive said, and what i would continue to maintain, is you cant take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like nafta, you say, well, i -- behind the scenes, i was disagreeing.', 'that doesnt work.', 'so you have to, i think, take both responsibility as well as credit.now there are several points that i think senator clinton made that i -- we need to discuss here.', 'first of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards.', 'keep in mind, i objected to the entire bill -- a bill that senator clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for.', 'and in one of the debates with you guys said, well, i voted for it, but i hoped it wouldnt pass -- which, as a general rule, doesnt work.', 'if you dont want it to pass, you vote against it.', '(laughter.', ')you know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care.', 'and look -- i do not in any way doubt that senator clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all americans.what i have said is that the way she approached it back in 93, i think, was wrong in part because she had the view that whats required is simply to fight.', 'and senator clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party.', 'and as a consequence, there were a number of people, like jim cooper of tennessee and bill bradley and pat moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations.', 'and we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done.i am absolutely clear that hope is not enough.', 'and it is not going to be easy to pass health care.', 'if it was, it would have already gotten done.', 'its not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country.', 'exxonmobil made $11 billion last quarter.', 'they are not going to give up those profits easily.but what i also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, were going to have to mobilize and inspire the american people so that theyre paying attention to what their government is doing.', 'and thats what ive been doing in this campaign, and thats what i will do as president.and theres nothing romantic or silly about that.', 'if the american people are activated, thats how change is going to happen.the second thing weve going to have to do is were actually going to have to go after the special interests.senator clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you cant just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away.', 'that is absolutely true, but it doesnt help if youre taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests.', 'they are less likely to go away.so it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence congress.', 'and yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the american people to get involved and pay attention.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word.', 'nothing more important.', 'last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out.', 'you checked yes on a questionnaire.', 'and now senator mccain has said, calling your bluff, lets do it.', 'you seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here.why wont you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election?sen.', 'obama: tim, i am not yet the nominee.', 'now, what ive said is, is that when i am the nominee, if i am the nominee -- because weve still got a bunch of contests left and senator clintons a pretty tough opponent.', 'if i am the nominee, then i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes.senator mccain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people arent exactly clear whether all the ts were crossed and the is were dotted.now what i want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign.', 'i said very early on i would not take pac money.', 'i would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists.', 'that -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because i had confidence that the american people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign.we have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50.', 'we average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the american people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody whos interested in good government and politics supports.mr.', 'russert: so you may opt out of public financing.', 'you may break your word.sen.', 'obama: what i -- what i have said is, at the point where im the nominee, at the point where its appropriate, i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility.', 'you have loaned your campaign $5 million.', 'you and your husband file a joint return.', 'you refuse to release that joint return, even though former president clinton has had significant overseas business dealings.your chief supporter here in ohio, governor strickland, made releasing his opponents tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, accountability, transparency.', 'if hes not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding?', 'we should question whats going on.why wont you release your tax return, so the voters of ohio, texas, vermont, rhode island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, the american people who support me are bankrolling my campaign.', 'thats -- thats obvious.', 'you can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that ive gotten.', 'and ever since i lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously.', 'im thrilled at so many people getting involved.', 'and were raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the internet.', 'and if anybodys out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to hillaryclinton.com, because thats whos funding my campaign.and i will release my tax returns.', 'i have consistently said that.', 'and i will --mr. russert: why not now?sen.', 'clinton: well, i will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, tim, because i have been as open as i can be.you have -- the public has 20 years of records for me, and i have very extensive filings with the senate where --mr. russert: so, before next tuesdays primary?sen.', 'clinton: well, i cant get it together by then, but i will certainly work to get it together.', 'im a little busy right now; i hardly have time to sleep.', 'but i will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain.mr.', 'russert: one other issue.', 'you talked about releasing documents.', 'on january 30th, the national archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady.', 'its now in the custody of former president clinton.', 'will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'ive urged that the process be as quick as possible.', 'its a cumbersome process, set up by law.', 'it doesnt just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position.', 'and i have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can.', 'now, also, president bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and i would urge the bush white house to move as quickly as possible.mr.', 'russert: but youve had it for more than a month.', 'will you get to him -- will you get it to the white house immediately?sen.', 'clinton: as soon as we can, tim.', 'ive urged that, and i hope it will happen.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments.on sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, chicago tribune: louis farrakhan backs obama for president at nation of islam convention in chicago.', 'do you accept the support of louis farrakhan?sen.', 'obama: you know, i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti-semitic comments.', 'i think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible.', 'i did not solicit this support.', 'he expressed pride in an african-american who seems to be bringing the country together.', 'i obviously cant censor him, but it is not support that i sought.', 'and were not doing anything, i assure you, formally or informally with minister farrakhan.mr.', 'russert: do you reject his support?sen.', 'obama: well, tim, you know, i cant say to somebody that he cant say that he thinks im a good guy.', '(laughter.)', 'you know, i -- you know, i -- i have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and i think that indicates to the american people what my stance is on those comments.mr.', 'russert: the problem some voters may have is, as you know, reverend farrakhan called judaism gutter religion.obama: tim, i think -- i am very familiar with his record, as are the american people.', 'thats why i have consistently denounced it.this is not something new.', 'this is something that -- i live in chicago.', 'he lives in chicago.', 'ive been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate.', 'and i have consistently distanced myself from him.russert: the title of one of your books, audacity of hope, you acknowledge you got from a sermon from reverend jeremiah wright, the head of the trinity united church.', 'he said that louis farrakhan epitomizes greatness.he said that he went to libya in 1984 with louis farrakhan to visit with moammar gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, your jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in hell.russert: what do you do to assure jewish-americans that, whether its farrakhans support or the activities of reverend jeremiah wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding israel and not in any way suggesting that farrakhan epitomizes greatness?obama: tim, i have some of the strongest support from the jewish community in my hometown of chicago and in this presidential campaign.', 'and the reason is because i have been a stalwart friend of israels.', 'i think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and i think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the united states is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the jewish community.and the reason that i have such strong support is because they know that not only would i not tolerate anti-semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what i want to do is rebuild what i consider to be a historic relationship between the african-american community and the jewish community.you know, i would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of jewish americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the south.', 'and that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened.but, you know, the reason that i have such strong support in the jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my u.s. senate campaign and its true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that i consistently have not only befriended the jewish community, not only have i been strong on israel, but, more importantly, ive been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable.when i was -- just last point i would make -- when i was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at ebenezer baptist church in conjunction with martin luther kings birthday in front of a large african-american audience, i specifically spoke out against anti- semitism within the african-american community.', 'and thats what gives people confidence that i will continue to do that when im president of the united states.williams: senator...clinton: i just want to add something here, because i faced a similar situation when i ran for the senate in 2000 in new york.', 'and in new york, there are more than the two parties, democratic and republican.', 'and one of the parties at that time, the independence party, was under the control of people who were anti-semitic, anti- israel.', 'and i made it very clear that i did not want their support.', 'i rejected it.', 'i said that it would not be anything i would be comfortable with.', 'and it looked as though i might pay a price for that.', 'but i would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either israel or jewish people in our country.and, you know, i was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of new york supported me and i won.', 'but at the time, i thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that.russert: are you suggesting senator obama is not standing on principle?clinton: no.', 'im just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it.', 'and theres a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'and i think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- i have no doubt that everything that barack just said is absolutely sincere.', 'but i just think, weve got to be even stronger.', 'we cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching.obama: tim, i have to say i dont see a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'theres no formal offer of help from minister farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it.', 'but if the word reject senator clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce, then im happy to concede the point, and i would reject and denounce.clinton: good.', 'good.', 'excellent.', '(applause)williams: rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing.were going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks.', 'well be back live from cleveland right after this.', '(commercial break)williams: we are back from cleveland state university.', 'we continue with our debate.the question beginning this segment is for you, senator obama.the national journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of ted kennedy.in a general election, going up against a republican party, looking for converts, republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than ted kennedy?obama: well, first of all, lets take a look at what the national journal rated us on.it turned out that senator clinton and i had differences on two votes.', 'the first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldnt go back, and i thought it was bad policy.the second -- and this, i think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- i supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the senate, because i thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the senate, that they werent being investigated by the senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it.this is something that ive tried to push as part of my ethics package.obama: it was rejected.', 'and according to the national journal, that position is a liberal position.now, i dont think thats a liberal position.', 'i think there are a lot of republicans and a lot of independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated.', 'so the categories dont make sense.and part of the reason i think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that senator obamas campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more independent votes than any other candidate in the democratic primary, and republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head?', 'its because people dont want to go back to those old categories of whats liberal and whats conservative.they want to see who is making sense, whos fighting for them, whos going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense?', 'thats what ive been doing, and thats why, you know, the proof is in the pudding.', 'weve been attracting more independent and republican support than anybody else, and thats why every poll shows that right now i beat john mccain in a match-up in the general election.williams: lets go from domestic to foreign affairs and tim russert.russert: before the primary on tuesday, on sunday, march 2, theres an election in russia for the successor to president putin.', 'what can you tell me about the man whos going to be mr. putins successor?clinton: well, i can tell you that hes a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by putin, who putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know.', 'you know, theres a lot of information still to be acquired.', 'that the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against putins hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising putin.', 'so this is a clever but transparent way for putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how were going to deal with russia going forward.i have been very critical of the bush administration for what i believe to have been an incoherent policy toward russia.', 'and with the reassertion of russias role in europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting irans nuclear ambitions, for example, its imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward russia.', 'but i have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by putin.russert: who will it be?', 'do you know his name?clinton: medvedev -- whatever.russert: yes.clinton: yes.russert: senator obama, do you know anything about him?obama: well, i think senator clinton speaks accurately about him.', 'he is somebody who was hand-picked by putin.', 'putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in russia in terms of running the government.', 'and, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of president bushs administration when he said -- you know, he met with putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him.he then proceeded to neglect our relationship with russia at a time when putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his european neighbors, as well as satellites of the former soviet union.', 'and so we did not send a signal to mr. putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us.', 'that is something that we have to change.russert: hes 42 years old, hes a former law professor.', 'he is mr. putins campaign manager.', 'he is going to be the new president of russia.', 'and if he says to the russian troops, you know what, why dont you go help serbia retake kosovo, what does president obama do?obama: well, i think that we work with the international community that has also recognized kosovo, and state that thats unacceptable.', 'but, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in nato to deal with this issue.we dont have to work in isolation.', 'and this is an area where i think that the clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned.obama: it has not been perfect, but it saved lives.', 'and we created a situation in which not only kosovo, but other parts of the former yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader european community.but, you know, be very clear: we have recognized the country of kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has great britain and many other countries in the region.', 'and i think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded.russert: before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service.', 'looking back through them, is there any words or vote that youd like to take back?senator clinton?clinton: well, obviously, ive said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding iraq was a sincere vote, i would not have voted that way again.i would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in iraq.', 'and i regret deeply that president bush waged a preemptive war, which i warned against and said i disagreed with.but i think that this election has to be about the future.', 'it has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what were going to inherit.you know, weve just been talking about russia.', 'we could have gone around the world.', 'we could have gone to latin america and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy.', 'we could have talked about africa and the failure to end the genocide in darfur.we could have gone on to talk about the challenge that china faces and the middle east, which is deteriorating under the pressures of hamas, hezbollah, and the interference that is putting israels security at stake.we could have done an entire program, tim, on what we will inherit from george bush.and what i believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of pennsylvania avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we dont have much time to try to make up for our losses.russert: but to be clear, youd like to have your vote back?clinton: absolutely.', 'ive said that many times.russert: senator obama, any statements or vote youd like to take back?obama: well, you know, when i first arrived in the senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding terri schiavo.', 'and i remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families.it wasnt something i was comfortable with, but it was not something that i stood on the floor and stopped.', 'and i think that was a mistake, and i think the american people understood that that was a mistake.', 'and as a constitutional law professor, i knew better.and so thats an example i think of where inaction...russert: this is the young woman with the feeding tube...obama: thats exactly right.russert: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not.obama: and i think thats an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action.but let me say this, since were wrapping up this debate.', 'we have gone through 20 debates now.', 'and, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and weve got four coming up, and maybe more after that.but the one thing im absolutely clear about is senator clinton has campaigned magnificently.', 'she is an outstanding public servant.', 'and im very proud to have been campaigning with her.and part of what i think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the american people.you know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics.', 'but when you spend as much time as senator clinton and i have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that peoples expectations are so modest.you know, theyre not looking for government to solve all of their problems.', 'they just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if theyre about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the american dream.you know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about.and, you know, i have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government.', 'thats why i think were both running, and im very pleased that ive had this opportunity to run with senator clinton.russert: but the voters can only choose one, brian.russert: and i think you have a question.williams: well, we dont have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but i am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both.', 'and ill ask it of you fist, senator obama.what is the fundamental question you believe senator clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in ohio and in texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee?', 'and then we will ask the same question of senator clinton.obama: i have to say, brian, i think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee.', 'now, i think id be better.', 'otherwise, i wouldnt be running.', 'but theres no doubt that senator clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than john mccain, who i respect and i honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of george bush over the last seven years.on economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we cant afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we cant afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe.', 'we cant afford it in terms of strategy.so i dont think that senator clinton has to answer a question as to whether shes capable of being president or our standard bearer.i will say this, that the reason i think im better as the nominee is that i can bring this country together i think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region.', 'and that is whats going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both senator clinton and i care so much about.and i also think i have a track record, starting from the days i moved to chicago as a community organizer, when i was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a united states senator, i think i bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the american people can have confidence that their voice is being heard.those are things -- those are qualities that i bring to this race, and i hope that the people of ohio, texas, rhode island and vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the united states.williams: senator clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question senator obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness?clinton: well, brian, there isnt any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the white house.as i said last week, you know, its been an honor to campaign.', 'i still intend to do everything i can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making.you know, obviously i am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which i think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous...(applause)... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are.so i feel that either one of us will make history.the question that i have been posing is, who can actually change the country?', 'and i do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see.you know, when i wasnt successful about getting universal health care, i didnt give up.', 'i just got to work and helped to create the childrens health insurance program.', 'and, you know, today in ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance.', 'and yet this morning in lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident.', 'and she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, will you help us?thats what my public life has been about.', 'i want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have.', 'and i will do whatever i can here in ohio, in texas, rhode island, in the states to come making that case.', 'because i think we do need a fighter back in the white house.you know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president.', 'its time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can.', 'and they deserve somebody who gets up in that white house and goes to bat for them.and thats

that they loved.', 'that’s in place right now.', '(applause.)', 'and this week, we’re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of

costs just keep on going up and up and up.', 'we’ll never have enough loan money, we’ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year.', 'we’ve got to get more out of what we pay for.now, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time.', 'in some states, they’re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.so this afternoon, i’ll visit the university of central missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students.', 'and in the coming months, i will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families.', 'it is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single american who’s willing to work for it.', '(applause.', ')now, so you’ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class.', 'but a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security.', 'for most families, that’s your biggest asset.', 'for most families, that’s where your life’s work has been invested.', 'and that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting.', 'the good news is over the past four years, we’ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes.', 'and today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer americans see their homes underwater.but we’re not done yet.', 'the key now is to encourage homeownership that isn’t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.so already, i’ve asked congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by mitt romney’s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year.', '(applause.)', 'it will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.i’m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no.', 'we’ll work with both parties to turn the page on fannie mae and freddie mac, and build a housing finance system that’s rock-solid for future generations.so we’ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country.', 'but along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement.', '(applause.)', 'i hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp.', 'it’s getting farther and farther away.', 'they cant see it.now, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered.', 'but we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all.', 'so as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they wont be able to retire.', '(applause.', ')and if congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, i should just say they don’t have to look far.', 'we mentioned immigration reform before.', 'economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the social security system for years.', 'so we should get that done.', '(applause.', ')good job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.fifth, im going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you’ve worked a lifetime to build.as we speak, were well on our way to fully implementing the affordable care act.', '(applause.)', 'were going to implement it.', 'now, if you’re one of the 85 percent of americans who already have health insurance either through the job or medicare or medicaid, you don’t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before.', 'you may not know it, but you do.', 'free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if youre on medicare -- that’s what the affordable care act means.', 'youre already getting a better deal.', 'no lifetime limits.if you don’t have health insurance, then starting on october 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and youll be able to comparison-shop online.', 'there will be a marketplace online, just like you’d buy a flat-screen tv or plane tickets or anything else youre doing online, and youll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.and if youre one of the up to half of all americans who’ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning january 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition.', '(applause.)', 'that’s what the affordable care act does.', 'that’s what it does.', '(applause.',

they think giving insurance to folks who don’t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that’s a bad thing.', 'but despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.so just last week, new york announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what theyre paying today -- 50 percent lower.', '(applause.)', 'so folks premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent.', 'and for them and for the millions of americans who’ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are 25 or 26 stay on their parents plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, youll have the security of knowing that everything you’ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out.', '(applause.', ')finally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- i’m going to make the case for why weve got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those americans who havent quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work.', '(applause.', ')there are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty.', 'here in america, we’ve never guaranteed success -- thats not what we do.', 'more than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant.', 'nobody is going to do something for you.', '(applause.)', 'weve tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy.', 'thats all for the good.', 'but that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if youre willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too.', 'thats the american idea.', '(applause.', ')unfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in america have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years.', 'and that’s a betrayal of the american idea.', 'and that’s why we have to do a lot more to give every american the chance to work their way into the middle class.the best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community.', 'so we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods.', '(applause.)', 'we need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in america to get them back on their feet.', 'and because no one who works full-time in america should have to live in poverty, i am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because its lower right now than it was when ronald reagan took office.', 'its time for the minimum wage to go up.', '(applause.', ')were not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life’s biggest winners or losers.', 'and after years in which we’ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in galesburg, folks in the quad cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break.', 'a plant leaves.', 'somebody gets sick.', 'somebody loses a home.', 'weve seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors.', 'weve seen it happen.', 'and that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.so good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- thats where i will focus my energies.', '(applause.)', 'thats where i will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.these are the plans that ill lay out across this country.', 'but i won’t be able to do it alone, so im going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause.', 'we’ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure congress to invest in our future.', 'and i’ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees.', 'and i’m going to highlight the ones that do just that.there are companies like costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits.', '(applause.)', 'companies like -- there are companies like the container store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it’s not just good for the employees, it’s good for their businesses to treat workers well.', 'it’s good for america.', '(applause.', ')so i’m going to be calling on the private sector to step up.', 'i will be saying to democrats we’ve got to question some of our old assumptions.', 'we’ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that dont work as well as they should.', '(applause.)', 'we’ve got to be willing to -- we’ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age.', 'we cant just -- democrats cant just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing.', 'if we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and i believe that -- we’ve an obligation to prove it.', 'and that means that we’ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.and we’ll need republicans in congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground.', '(applause.', ')it’s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, mr. president, these are all good ideas, but some of you’ve said before; some of them sound great, but you cant get those through congress.', 'republicans won’t agree with you.', 'and i say, look, the fact is there are republicans in congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas i’ll be proposing.', 'i know because they’ve said so.', 'but they worry they’ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.now, there are others who will dismiss every idea i put forward either because they’re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for america -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.in either case, i say to these members of congress: i’m laying

are talking about maybe just keeping all the bush tax cuts for a year or two.', 'those arent -- thats not going to happen?geithner: i dont believe it should and i dont believe it will.', 'again, because what the presidents proposed is to make sure were leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back.', 'that we heal the damage caused by this crisis.tapper: job creation has not gone as well as you hoped.', 'what more can you do?', 'i know theres this small business lending initiative.', 'what more can you do given the lack of appetite on capitol hill for any spending programs?', 'any more stimulus?geithner: well you know, the presidents proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to.', 'hed support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom.tapper: fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the congress has not acted on that.geithner: they havent yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it.', 'theyre going to, were going to keep at that.', 'but right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again.now, weve seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector.', 'thats pretty good.tapper: by the private sector.geithner: pretty good this early in a recession.tapper: although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs.geithner: but only because of census.', 'but you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and thats whats critical.and youre seeing that happen now.', 'now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace.', 'but i think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis.', 'the scars ran very deep.', 'devastating damage.', 'its going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this.', 'but were making progress.tapper: in 2009 when president obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for.', 'this time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.republicans on capitol hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.given the fact that were going to be -- were going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment.', 'isnt it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so were not just laying this burden on our future generations?geithner: i dont think so.', 'in a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep.', 'with this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, its appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.tapper: many of the details on the wall street reform bill that president obama just signed will be determined by regulators.', 'in fact, the bill also gives more power to some regulators, some of the same ones who failed us the last time around.why should we be confident that theyre going to get it right either with the rule making or next time theres a crisis?geithner: excellent question.', 'but actually, the theory, the basic strategy in this reform bill does not rest on the wisdom of regulators.', 'it does two very important things, though.', 'itll help consumers make better choices with better disclosure, much more clarity about the terms of the credit card contract or mortgage loan so they get better protection against the risk of being taken advantage of.but it also gives authority we did not have to put in place strong constraints on risk taking on all the nations largest institutions.', 'that authority did not exist before and it was central to what caused the near collapse of the financial system.tapper: will these powers have allowed you, if had been secretary of treasury at the time or your predecessor hank paulsen to have staved off the financial crisis?geithner: i dont think theres any reform bill, no law in any country that can prevent all financial crises.', 'but if we had had this authority as a country, it -- we would have been able to limit risk taking and deal with the trauma that came from the stakes these firms made much more easily.', 'it would have caused much less damage.', 'it would have been much less severe, caused much less damage to the basic fortunes americans and businesses across the country and to our -- and our long term fiscal position.tapper: you eluded to the consumer financial protection bureau that was created.', 'many liberals and labor unions and consumer groups say theres one person they want for that job.', 'elizabeth warren.', 'the woman who thought it up.do you support that idea?geithner: she is a enormously effective advocate for reform.', 'probably the most effective advocate for reform for consumers for consumer protection in the country.', 'she has huge credibility and she played a decisive role in helping make the public case for reform and she was early on this, way ahead of everybody else.tapper: 2007 she wrote that -- that -- she came up with that idea.geithner: and even before that she was pointing out to people the risks of whats happening in the housing market and credit market.', 'so she has enormous credibility and shed be an excellent leader of that institution.', 'but thats a decision the presidents going to make.tapper: some in the white house say that -- that youve had concerns about her appointment because she shes been a sharp critic of you, shes been a sharp critic of treasury department policies.', 'do you have concerns?geithner: i dont have concerns and i should say in that context that she has been playing a very important role in providing oversight over the programs we put in place to break the back of this financial crisis.', 'you know, put out this financial fire.tapper: ken feinberg issued a report including that u.s. banks paid out $1.6 billion in unwanted -- unwarranted bonuses to top earners during the height of the meltdown.', 'seventeen banks made these payouts after getting tarp funds, after getting bailout funds.geithner: its a -- you know, it really is an incredible thing.', 'and thats what he reminded of which is in early 09, on the basis of performance in 08, in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the great depression, firms that had taken support from the government because they could not manage without it still paid out substantial sums of money to people who made the decisions that caused the crisis.tapper: is there nothing that can be done about this?geithner: well, you know, he spoke to that earlier this week.', 'what he did do, though, and this was enormously effective was he went and used the authority he had to change behavior going forward.', 'so you didnt have taxpayers money after he had that authority go to enrich the people that had brought the system to the edge of collapse.now, what hes also done and what our responsibility is to make sure these firms can never again go back to paying their executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the country as a whole, the economy as a whole.', 'so, hes done a great job.', 'very tough judgments.', 'limited authority in some cases, but he uses authority very well.tapper: why is it that u.s. automakers when they received bailout funds had to take serious steps to take -- what are called haircuts?', 'salary reductions, layoffs.', 'and banks didnt.', 'banks -- i mean, you had ken feinberg supervising their salaries as long as they were receiving tarp money, but then they paid the money back and did whatever they wanted.', 'how come banks didnt have to do that?geithner: great question.', 'and thats why we have financial reform.', 'because we had for the country as a whole, a process of bankruptcy for dealing with failure.', 'we did not have a similar process that could deal with the failure of large financial institutions.that was a tragic failure for the country because what it meant is when firms like aig or lehman or bear stearns manage themselves to the point where they could not survive without the government, we had no tools like bankruptcy to force them to restructure and protect the taxpayer from losses.', 'but what this financial reform will do is to give us that authority.', 'a type of bankruptcy regime that we can use for these large institutions because, again, this is a basic commitment in the bill.', 'banks should be paying for the cost of bank failures.', 'we dont want the taxpayers paying for the cost of bank failures.', 'and we should have the ability to dismember them, put them out of existence, put them out of their misery without it causing catastrophic damage to the economy as a whole.tapper: the treasury department issued a currency report and concluded that china was not manipulating its currency.', 'very few legislators on capitol hill seem to agree with that report, and im wondering if you agree with it.geithner: well, what china did, and this is the important thing, after a long period of pegging their currency to the dollar, holding their currency constant against the dollar, they have now started to allow it to move upward again to appreciate, to strengthen their response to market forces.now, of course, they just started that process.', 'its just the beginning, and what matters to us and to all of chinas trading partners is that they let that currency appreciate, as they did the last time they allowed us to move.', 'what matters to us is how fast and how far they let it go.tapper: but you stand by the idea, stand by the assertion, that china is not manipulating its currency?geithner: oh, absolutely.', 'but again, they begin the process of letting it start to reflect market forces.', 'thats very good for china.', 'its very good for the united states.tapper: lastly, this has been an odd week for the obama administration -- not necessarily for the treasury department, but for the obama administration, given the whole kerfuffle with shirley sherrod and the agriculture department.', 'president obama has said this is a teaching moment for him and his administration.', 'secretary vilsack said something similar.did you learn anything from watching your colleagues go through this?geithner: well, as the president said, i think you saw a general rush to judgment everywhere -- in the press and outside the press.', 'and i think i agree with it -- its something that we should all take some caution from and look at these things carefully.', 'but he spoke to that, i thought, well earlier this week.tapper: secretary geithner, thanks so much for joining us.geithner: thanks, jake.tapper: and joining me now is someone who also knows from budget challenges, new jerseys republican governor, chris christie.', 'governor, thank you so much.', 'welcome to this week.christie: im happy to be here.tapper: so, governor, your victory last november in the very blue state of new jersey was heralded by republicans nationally, seen as a blueprint for their victories.', 'now, a lot of republicans who wanted you to win and admired your campaign said that you won mainly by criticizing incumbent democratic governor corzine, not necessarily by a specific, detailed agenda.and im wondering if, first of all, you agree with that.', 'and, second of all, how do you see your victory in the context of what republicans can do this november?christie: well, first off, jake, i think what we did in new jersey last year was say very specifically what direction we wanted to take the state in.', 'we said we wanted to have less spending, smaller government, lower taxes, and commonsense regulation that was going to help to grow private-sector jobs.and so i didnt go line item by line item through the budget during a campaign, and i didnt think it was the right thing to do.now, in terms of what it tells us going forward, i think republicans across the country need to get back to our brand, and i think that is the republican brand.', 'its why i became a republican: less government, lower taxes, less spending, and commonsense regulation that grows private-sector jobs.and so i think if my win tells anything, it means if we get back to basics as republicans, then we speak to some of the concerns people have in new jersey and across the country.tapper: you know, the biggest item on your agenda so far has been dealing with the budget and the huge deficit in new jersey.', 'here you are on cnbc.', '(begin video clip)christie: we passed a budget that cuts $11 billion from our states budget, balances it without any new tax increases on the people of the state of new jersey.', '(end video clip)tapper: now, patrick murray, director of polling at monmouth university, says, quote, thats a nice talking point, but its absolutely untrue.', 'there are a lot of legal obligations that the state has that the governor just simply ignored.', 'and the star-ledger reported, budget analysts say the $11 billion deficit was closed largely by avoiding massive costs.', 'the budget skipped a $3.1 billion payment to the pension fund, continuing a decade-long pattern christie had criticized, and did not pay $1.7 billion to schools under the states formula for education aid.so these billions that youre not funding, are you doing this just by executive fiat?', 'how does this work?', 'because theyre legal obligations, right?christie: no, listen, the legislature passed this budget.', 'the budget i presented on march 16th has $11 billion in less spending than was projected to be done through the corzine administration.and so patrick murray is a pollster, and hes ok as a pollster, but hes not going to be all that great as a governor, because what we did here was we took $1.7 billion less in education funding.', 'well, a billion of that was federal stimulus money that had been spent in one year by the corzine administration, and we were left with $1 billion hole.', 'really what we did was we reduced it by about $820 million in educational spending.across the board, jake, we had to reduce spending.', 'every department of state government was cut.', 'and so there are going to be some cuts you make you like and some that you like less, but when you have an $11 billion hole to fill, you have to fill it.finally, on pensions, i wasnt going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system.', 'we need pension reform.', 'i passed some already for new hires in march, and now this fall were going to go after current employees and pension reform and health benefit reform because were going broke.tapper: now, one -- in that clip, you said that there were no new tax increases on people of the state of new jersey, but also your budget did not fund $1 billion in direct property tax rebates, the homestead rebate.', 'that means that peoples property taxes are going to go up.christie: well, no, what we did, jake, was we did a couple of things.', 'first, we changed it from a property tax rebate program to a direct credit.', 'we spent about $20 million a year in processing these checks and borrowing the money to send out to people.', 'weve eliminated that.and what we did was we skipped three-quarters of that payment in the current fiscal year as part of the shared sacrifice that everybody was going to have to make.', 'i wasnt going to cut just programs for the vulnerable; i wasnt going to cut just programs for the rich, but programs for the middle class.', 'everything had to be cut.but that program will be back as a direct tax credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 11.tapper: now, that shared sacrifice -- i mean, is that not a tax increase, even if its a -- i mean, if youre -- if youre taking away a tax rebate, even temporarily, thats a tax increase, isnt it?christie: no, i dont -- i dont see it that way.', 'and in addition, what we did was were giving the tools now to municipalities with a 2 percent property tax cap that we passed this july by me calling the legislature back into special session and with the tools that were going to be passing this fall for them to cut spending even more at the municipal level so that people are not going to see a huge increase over the course of the next four years in their property taxes at all.tapper: ok, theres been a lot of tension between you and teachers, as youve been wielding your budget ax.', 'heres one example from a recent town hall meeting.', '(begin video clip)(unknown): youre not compensating me for my education and youre not compensating me for my experience.', 'thats...christie: well, you know what?', 'then you dont have to do it.', '(unknown): teachers do it because they love it.', 'thats the only reason i do it.christie: thats good.', 'well, then -- well, and you -- and, listen, and teachers go into knowing what the pay scale is.', '(end video clip)tapper: i know you said your issue is with teachers unions and not with individual teachers, but what do you say to residents of your state who say that they like your stance on taking on the teachers unions, but a clip like that makes it seems like you dont really respect the teaching profession.christie: well, i do respect the teaching profession.', 'im a product of the public schools in the state of new jersey, and i care deeply about our public education.but heres what we cant have any longer: we cant have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession at the cost to the people who have been hurt by the recession the most.for instance, the building trade unions in our state, they have unemployment at 35 percent to 50 percent.', 'theyre getting no raises.', 'theyre getting no benefits any longer, yet their property taxes continue to go up to pay for 4 percent and 5 percent salary increases demanded by the teachers unions in a 0 percent inflation world and that most of the teachers in new jersey, because of their unions, pay nothing towards their health benefits from the day theyre hired until the day they die.now, i have to tell you, jake, we cant have one set of rules for one small sector -- the public sector unions -- and a different set of rules for everyone whos being hurt by this recession and say that those people are being hurt the most by the recession.', 'by the way, you pay for this special treatment.i mean, now, that may be tough talk to people, and its direct, but candidly, thats what we have to do if we want to get budgets under control in new jersey and around the country.tapper: youre -- youve been known in the statehouse and nationally for a blunt style.', 'heres an example of that.', '(begin video clip)christie: like it or not, you guys are stuck with me for four years, and im going to say things directly.', 'when you ask me questions, im going to answer them directly, straightly, bluntly, and nobody in new jersey is going to have to wonder where i am on an issue.', '(end video clip)tapper: thats a high bar, so lets do it.', 'directly, straightly, bluntly, should new jersey join the lawsuit that other states have filed against the obama administration over the individual mandate in the health care reform bill?christie: i have both my attorney general and my commissioner of health studying two things: first, what are the chances of succeeding in the lawsuit?', 'because with limited resources in new jersey, im not going to throw good money after bad.', 'and, secondly, whats the effect of this 2,000-page bill going to be on the people of new jersey?', 'when i get answers back from them, ill make a decision.tapper: whats your impulse?christie: i dont have an impulse.', 'im waiting to get briefed on it.tapper: immigration reform.', 'youve said this issue is too important to demagogue.', 'who is demagoguing in the senate right now?', 'and what is the solution to immigration reform?christie: well, first of all, on demagoguing, i wasnt talking about anything thats going on now.', 'thats a 2-year-old quote, and there were some things going on in new jersey at the time while i was u.s. attorney that i thought was demagoguery, and i called it that.listen, this issue is a federal issue that should be handled by the feds and should be fixed finally.', 'as a former united states attorney, i had to deal with these issues for seven years, and we simply didnt have the resources to deal with them effectively.so the president and the congress have to step up to the plate, they have to secure our borders, and they have to put forward a commonsense path to citizenship for people.and until they do that, states are going to struggle all over the country with this problem, and so is federal law enforcement, who doesnt have the resources to do it effectively.tapper: is the republican party in congress been a help or hindrance to that cause for immigration reform?christie: i think it depends on which republican youre talking about.', 'i dont think the party has had a generalized stance.', 'i think theres been, you know, folks who have been all over the map on this issue.', 'and, candidly, i dont think theres one general republican position.tapper: well, there are democrats offering a bill, and they cant -- they cant get any republicans to join them.christie: well, listen, the fact of the matter is that they have to find a way to build consensus.', 'and i think thats what the president said he wanted to do when he came to town, and i think thats the challenge for those who are in the majority: find a way to build consensus.thats what ive been doing in new jersey, jake.', 'we have a democratic legislature.', 'ive passed a budget with those $11 billion in cuts with a democratic legislature, a property tax cap with a democratic legislature, pension reforms with a democratic legislature.if you want to lead and build consensus, you can, and its on the obligation of those people in charge to build consensus.tapper: two more quick questions.', 'one, the stimulus bill.', 'net positive for new jersey or negative?christie: i think short-term positive, and were now feeling the negative.tapper: lastly, i know you like to talk about new jerseys cultural icons.', 'you prefer to talk about springsteen, but the new york times today has this profile of snooki from jersey shore.christie: sure.tapper: mtvs jersey shore, positive for new jersey or negative?christie: negative for new jersey, i mean, because it -- what it does is it takes a bunch of new yorkers, who are -- most of the people on jersey shore are new yorkers -- takes a bunch of new yorkers, drops them at the jersey shore, and tries to make america feel like this is new jersey.i could tell people, they want to know what new jersey really is?', 'i welcome them to come to new jersey any time.', 'the jersey shore is a beautiful place, and its a place that everybody should come on vacation this summer.', 'weve got another six weeks or so of summer left.', 'come to new jersey.tapper: governor christie, thanks so much for -- for sharing your views.christie: thank you, jake.tapper: the roundtable is next with sam donaldson, cokie roberts, donna brazile, and stephen hayes.', 'and later, the sunday funnies.', '(commercial break)(begin video clip)oreilly: department of agriculture official shirley sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing.', 'ms. sherrod must resign immediately.sherrod: i was faced with having to help a white person save their land, so i didnt give him the full force of what i could do.', '(unknown): the full speech has been released by the naacp, and it backs up ms. sherrods version.tapper: apparently shes watching this briefing, shirley sherrod, on cnn right now.', 'is there anything you want to say to her?gibbs: on behalf of the administration, i offer our apologies.vilsack: i asked for shirleys forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me.', '(unknown): he jumped the gun.sherrod: to have people think that i was a racist really, really hurt.', '(end video clip)tapper: laffaire sherrod, one of the many topics well talk about on our roundtable today with stephen hayes from the weekly standard and fox news channel, donna brazile, the democratic strategist and our dear friend, and abc news own sam donaldson, and, of course, cokie roberts.thanks, all of you, for being here.well get to sherrod in a second, but first i just want to talk a little bit about the geithner interview.', 'secretary geithner said he hopes there isnt going to be much of a fight over trying to keep the tax cuts for the lower income, under $200,000, $250,000 for a family, but repeal them or let them expire for wealthier americans.', 'is there going to be a fight?hayes: yes, hope will only take you so far.', 'i think there will be a fight, and i think one of the main constituencies in the fight is going to be moderate democrats, as you pointed out in your questioning of him.i think youre going to see moderate democrats who walk back from the administrations eagerness to see this tax hike on what theyre calling the wealthiest americans.tapper: donna?brazile: the 2011 budget anticipates that we can close the deficit largely by allowing the bush tax cuts to expire.', 'i think the president should not get into the argument should he, should he not, but rather to present a series of -- a new tax package.', 'dont call it bush tax cuts, but a new tax package that is aimed toward the middle class, towards small businesses, that will close tax loopholes, and to ensure that the -- whatever package we put forward is fiscally prudent, its paid for, and that it helps spur economic growth.tapper: sam, where do you think this is going?donaldson: well, of course, they should continue those tax cuts for 95 percent, as secretary geithner said.', 'and as far as the wealthy are concerned to go from 35 percent as the top rate before the deductions to 39 percent is not going to kill them.', 'it really wont.', 'theyre going to have something to eat the next day.but heres my proposal.', 'there is a point...tapper: a proposal from sam donaldson.donaldson: heres my proposal.', '(unknown): i like that.donaldson: there is a point that at this moment perhaps we should continue to extend the tax cuts across the board, but put in a trigger.', 'when our national product gets better, when our unemployment gets better, use some other indexes.', 'then the trigger automatically raises it for the wealthy back to 39 percent.roberts: triggers never work.', 'weve put in triggers -- congress puts in triggers all the time.', 'its basically fig leaves, and then they dont -- they dont ever do it.donaldson: the reason it doesnt work, cokie, is that congress doesnt follow through.roberts: thats my point.donaldson: i dont think theres a chance that republicans would agree with my modest suggestion.', '(crosstalk)roberts: ... look, its obviously not just an economic question.', 'its a political question.', 'and -- and who gets to frame it?', 'do the democrats get to say the republicans claim that theyre against the deficit, but they want to keep in all these tax cuts for those really rich people, including those wall street bankers who got those huge bonuses, or do the republicans say, look, here are democrats going at you again, raising your taxes just so they can -- just so they can raise that spending, because they want the government to take over every -- every part of american life?and i think thats a lot of what this debate will be framed around and what this election will be framed around.tapper: and this debate comes as ben bernanke, the fed chair, is calling the economic outlook unusually uncertain, which is chilling words for some people.roberts: including the market.', 'i mean, he said those words and 200 points down.donaldson: the market is beginning to start to levitate again, maybe unwisely, but europe has produced better numbers just this past week.', 'the earnings season looks really good for some of the big companies, not just the banks, but some of the companies, caterpillar, some of the people who make things.', 'i think were going to come out of it.hayes: but the numbers are mixed.', 'i mean, thats the rosy scenario.', '(crosstalk)hayes: the numbers are mixed, and there are plenty of numbers that are pointing in the other direction.', 'i think if you look at the big picture, the question i think facing -- facing sort of everybody in washington right now with respect to the tax cuts, one of the things that surprised me most about your interview with tim geithner was that he said raising taxes on the wealthiest americans wont have a negative effect on growth, that was a stunning statement to me.i think you could poll 1,000 economists and find very few of them who would agree with what tim geithner just said, and one of those people is christina romer in the white house, who has written before about the negative effects of tax cuts, and, in fact, has an article...(crosstalk)roberts: of tax increases.hayes: ... of tax increases, and has an article in the current american economic review, june 2010, in which she says tax increases have a large and substantial negative effect on consumption and growth.roberts: now, they have to be really especially careful about the estate tax, however, because...donaldson: there is none.roberts: well, there isnt one at the moment.tapper: theres not right now.', 'and the heirs of george steinbrenner are happy for that.roberts: exactly.', 'so then if they bring it back, theyd better do it overnight, you know, so that people arent doing in their parents in anticipation.tapper: donna, you wanted to say something?brazile: everyone is concerned about the deficit, and thats why we have to be careful how we frame this.', 'i mean, you and i both know that -- stephen, that over the last 10 years weve seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown.', 'meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, theyve seen their wages stagnate.so i think the president needs to be wise enough to take a look at the entire array of tax cuts that he could provide to small businesses and middle-income individuals that will help spur economic growth.roberts: but, of course, the one number that matters is the unemployment number.', 'i mean, that is the number that everybody really cares about.', 'and -- and the president himself is now saying, again, expected to get to 8 percent or lower until maybe the end of 2012.and that -- you know, that then becomes not only a dampening -- have a dampening effect on the economy, but that becomes...(crosstalk)donaldson: there are two commissions...roberts: ... political problem.donaldson: ... running right now, the presidential commission appointed and a private one with pete domenici and alice rivlin that are looking at this problem of our debt and our economic situation, and both of them say, by the end of the year when they report, were going to be stunned by the projections for this country if we dont start cutting unnecessary expenses and getting hold of the debt.roberts: well...tapper: its not just unnecessary expenses.', 'some of them are necessary expenses.', 'its medicare and social security.', '(crosstalk)donaldson: ... building a second engine for a fighter that the defense department says is unnecessary?roberts: well, you know perfectly well, sam, that that doesnt save you any money.', 'i mean, you start...donaldson: oh, a few billion.roberts: you could close down this capitol or turn it into condos and you could close down every domestic program that we have and youd still have a deficit because of social security, medicare...donaldson: thats defense spending.roberts: ... and interest on the national debt.brazile: and the loss of revenues.', 'i mean, this recession has taken a bite out of the economy.', 'were not collecting money, so we need to...(crosstalk)roberts: particularly on capital gains.brazile: thats right.hayes: which -- which is why the single most important thing the government can do right now is get out of the way of private-sector growth.', 'and raising taxes in a recession on whomever is, i think, one of the most foolish things you could possibly do at this time.and, look, the administration implicitly buys the argument that raising taxes in a recession is a bad idea.', 'youve heard administration officials articulate this before, and its behind what they did in the original stimulus with the tax cuts.', '(crosstalk)donaldson: so sign on to the idea that now its a bad idea, but at some point were going to come out of this recession.tapper: well, there is -- and there are voices in the administration...(crosstalk)donaldson: ... and now they raised them, ok?tapper: ... talking about -- there are people in the administration talking about maybe just keeping the bush tax cuts in place for everyone for a year longer...roberts: well, thats what you were saying.tapper: ... or not, but geithner said no.donaldson: but a trigger.', 'otherwise the congress will never come back and say...(crosstalk)hayes: ... have the same debate -- have the same debate in two years.brazile: im going to be like the republicans for 30 seconds.', 'how do we pay for it?', 'how do we pay for it?', 'we know that the bush tax cuts is one of the driving forces...(crosstalk)hayes: it is -- it is part of it, but thats on static scoring.', 'if you look at what it does for economic growth, you could argue that youll make up some of the revenues...brazile: so how many jobs were created during its period when we had the bush tax cuts, from 2001 to 2008?', 'how many jobs?hayes: i dont -- i dont know the number.brazile: hardly any.', 'we lost jobs.', 'thats the point.', 'the point is, we should have tax cuts that help spur economic growth.', 'bottom line, its about jobs, jobs, jobs.roberts: i think thats right.', 'the question is, what cuts?', 'and not just cuts.', 'and i think that...hayes: sure, ok. lets say that small business is the engine for job growth.brazile: i agree with that.hayes: but the people that were talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners.', 'so if youre talking about cutting taxes for people who can...donaldson: most of the wealthy...hayes: ... put people back to work, thats who youre talking about.', '(crosstalk)donaldson: ...

obama’s administration – but now that president trump is the man in the white house, it’s back with a vengeance.democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “i” word, hoping to nail trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the new york times claimed a memo written by former fbi director james comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser michael flynn.some members of congress are getting in on the action.', 'they include reps. maxine water, d-calif., and al green, d-texas.', 'even a republican, rep. justin amash, claimed wednesday there are grounds to impeach president trump.', 'house oversign committee chair rep. jason chaffetz, r-utah, asked for the alleged comey memo and other documents.', 'chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information.', 'and sen. john mccain, r-ariz., invoked “watergate.”now the democratic party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue.', 'more than 1 million people signed a petition calling on congress to impeach trump.wasting no time wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left’s impeachment calls.', 'msnbc launched a watergate ad implying trump is america’s new richard nixon.“watergate.', 'we know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,” says msnbc host chris hayes, who hinted that trump is next on the impeachment chopping block.', '“now, who knows where the questions will take us.', 'but i know this: i’m not going to stop asking them.”meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around washington, d.c., demanding all white house staffers resign wednesday.the posters read: “if you work for this white house you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of americans’ tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason.', 'also, any wars will be on your soul.', '… resign now.”but constitutional scholar jonathan turley, who voted for president obama, warned “impeachment” enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with president trump.', 'why?at this time, there’s no evidence trump actually committed a crime.“the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo,” turley wrote in a may 17 opinion piece posted at the hill.', 'turley explained:for the first time, the comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding trump into the scope of the united states criminal code.however, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup.', 'some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office.', 'not surprising, within minutes of the new york times report, the response was a chorus of breathless “gotcha” announcements.', 'but this memo is neither the pentagon papers nor the watergate tapes.', 'indeed, it raises as many questions for comey as it does trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.a good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 u.s.c.', '1503. the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo.', 'there are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors.', 'none would fit this case.', 'that leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the “due administration of justice.”however, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence “corruptly” when trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate.', 'the term “corruptly” is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted “with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.” encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper

immediate release march 27, 2009remarks by the presidenton a new strategy for afghanistan and pakistanroom 450dwight d. eisenhower executive office building9:40 a.m. edtthe president: good morning.', 'please be seated.before i begin today, let me acknowledge, first of all, your excellencies, all the ambassadors who are in attendance.', 'i also want to acknowledge both the civilians and our military personnel that are about to be deployed to the region.', 'and i am very grateful to all of you for your extraordinary work.i want to acknowledge general david petraeus, whos here, and has been doing an outstanding job at centcom, and we appreciate him.', 'i want to thank bruce reidel -- bruce is down at the end here -- who has worked extensively on our strategic review.', 'i want to acknowledge karl eikenberry, whos here, and is our ambassador-designate to afghanistan.', 'and to my national security team, thanks for their outstanding work.today, im announcing a comprehensive, new strategy for afghanistan and pakistan.', 'and this marks the conclusion of a careful policy review, led by bruce, that i ordered as soon as i took office.', 'my administration has heard from our military commanders, as well as our diplomats.', 'weve consulted with the afghan and pakistani governments, with our partners and our nato allies, and with other donors and international organizations.', 'weve also worked closely with members of congress here at home.', 'and now i’d like to speak clearly and candidly to the american people.the situation is increasingly perilous.', 'its been more than seven years since the taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of afghanistan and pakistan.', 'attacks against our troops, our nato allies, and the afghan government have risen steadily.', 'and most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for american forces.many people in the united states -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question: what is our purpose in afghanistan?', 'after so many years, they ask, why do our men and women still fight and die there?', 'and they deserve a straightforward answer.so let me be clear: al qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in pakistan and afghanistan.', 'multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al qaeda is actively planning attacks on the united states homeland from its safe haven in pakistan.', 'and if the afghan government falls to the taliban -- or allows al qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.the future of afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor, pakistan.', 'in the nearly eight years since 9/11, al qaeda and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the pakistani frontier.', 'this almost certainly includes al qaedas leadership: osama bin laden and ayman al-zawahiri.', 'they have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide, to train terrorists, to communicate with followers, to plot attacks, and to send fighters to support the insurgency in afghanistan.', 'for the american people, this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world.but this is not simply an american problem -- far from it.', 'it is, instead, an international security challenge of the highest order.', 'terrorist attacks in london and bali were tied to al qaeda and its allies in pakistan, as were attacks in north africa and the middle east, in islamabad and in kabul.', 'if there is a major attack on an asian, european, or african city, it, too, is likely to have ties to al qaedas leadership in pakistan.', 'the safety of people around the world is at stake.for the afghan people, a return to taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance, international isolation, a paralyzed economy, and the denial of basic human rights to the afghan people -- especially women and girls.', 'the return in force of al qaeda terrorists who would accompany the core taliban leadership would cast afghanistan under the shadow of perpetual violence.as president, my greatest responsibility is to protect the american people.', 'we are not in afghanistan to control that country or to dictate its future.', 'we are in afghanistan to confront a common enemy that threatens the united states, our friends and our allies, and the people of afghanistan and pakistan who have suffered the most at the hands of violent extremists.so i want the american people to understand that we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future.', 'thats the goal that must be achieved.', 'that is a cause that could not be more just.', 'and to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: we will defeat you.to achieve our goals, we need a stronger, smarter and comprehensive strategy.', 'to focus on the greatest threat to our people, america must no longer deny resources to afghanistan because of the war in iraq.', 'to enhance the military, governance and economic capacity of afghanistan and pakistan, we have to marshal international support.', 'and to defeat an enemy that heeds no borders or laws of war, we must recognize the fundamental connection between the future of afghanistan and pakistan -- which is why ive appointed ambassador richard holbrooke, who is here, to serve as special representative for both countries, and to work closely with general petraeus to integrate our civilian and military efforts.let me start by addressing the way forward in pakistan.the united states has great respect for the pakistani people.', 'they have a rich history and have struggled against long odds to sustain their democracy.', 'the people of pakistan want the same things that we want: an end to terror, access to basic services, the opportunity to live their dreams, and the security that can only come with the rule of law.', 'the single greatest threat to that future comes from al qaeda and their extremist allies, and that is why we must stand together.the terrorists within pakistans borders are not simply enemies of america or afghanistan -- they are a grave and urgent danger to the people of pakistan.', 'al qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand pakistanis since 9/11.', 'theyve killed many pakistani soldiers and police.', 'they assassinated benazir bhutto.', 'theyve blown up buildings, derailed foreign investment, and threatened the stability of the state.', 'so make no mistake: al qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing pakistan from within.its important for the american people to understand that pakistan needs our help in going after al qaeda.', 'this is no simple task.', 'the tribal regions are vast, they are rugged, and they are often ungoverned.', 'and thats why we must focus our military assistance on the tools, training and support that pakistan needs to root out the terrorists.', 'and after years of mixed results, we will not, and cannot, provide a blank check.pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders.', 'and we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.the governments ability to destroy these safe havens is tied to its own strength and security.', 'to help pakistan weather the economic crisis, we must continue to work with the imf, the world bank and other international partners.', 'to lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation, we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both india and pakistan.', 'to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must make clear that our relationship with pakistan is grounded in support for pakistans democratic institutions and the pakistani people.', 'and to demonstrate through deeds as well as words a commitment that is enduring, we must stand for lasting opportunity.a campaign against extremism will not succeed with bullets or bombs alone.', 'al qaedas offers the people of pakistan nothing but destruction.', 'we stand for something different.', 'so today, i am calling upon congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by john kerry and richard lugar that authorizes $1.5 billion in direct support to the pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools and roads and hospitals, and strengthen pakistans democracy.', 'im also calling on congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by maria cantwell, chris van hollen and peter hoekstra that creates opportunity zones in the border regions to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued with violence.', 'and we will ask our friends and allies to do their part -- including at the donors conference in tokyo next month.i dont ask for this support lightly.', 'these are challenging times.', 'resources are stretched.', 'but the american people must understand that this is a down payment on our own future -- because the security of america and pakistan is shared.', 'pakistans government must be a stronger partner in destroying these safe havens, and we must isolate al qaeda from the pakistani people.', 'and these steps in pakistan are also indispensable to our efforts in afghanistan, which will see no end to violence if insurgents move freely back and forth across the border.security demands a new sense of shared responsibility.', 'and thats why we will launch a standing, trilateral dialogue among the united states, afghanistan and pakistan.', 'our nations will meet regularly, with secretaries clinton and secretary gates leading our effort.', 'together, we must enhance intelligence sharing and military cooperation along the border, while addressing issues of common concern like trade, energy, and economic development.this is just one part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent afghanistan from becoming the al qaeda safe haven that it was before 9/11.', 'to succeed, we and our friends and allies must reverse the talibans gains, and promote a more capable and accountable afghan government.our troops have fought bravely against a ruthless enemy.', 'our civilians have made great sacrifices.', 'our allies have borne a heavy burden.', 'afghans have suffered and sacrificed for their future.', 'but for six years, afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in iraq.', 'now, we must make a commitment that can accomplish our goals.ive already ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops that had been requested by general mckiernan for many months.', 'these soldiers and marines will take the fight to the taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border.', 'this push will also help provide security in advance of the important presidential elections in afghanistan in august.at the same time, we will shift the emphasis of our mission to training and increasing the size of afghan security forces, so that they can eventually take the lead in securing their country.', 'thats how we will prepare afghans to take responsibility for their security, and how we will ultimately be able to bring our own troops home.for three years, our commanders have been clear about the resources they need for training.', 'and those resources have been denied because of the war in iraq.', 'now, that will change.', 'the additional troops that we deployed have already increased our training capacity.', 'and later this spring we will deploy approximately 4,000 u.s. troops to train afghan security forces.', 'for the first time, this will truly resource our effort to train and support the afghan army and police.', 'every american unit in afghanistan will be partnered with an afghan unit, and we will seek additional trainers from our nato allies to ensure that every afghan unit has a coalition partner.', 'we will accelerate our efforts to build an afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the afghans go forward.this push must be joined by a dramatic increase in our civilian effort.', 'afghanistan has an elected government, but it is undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people.', 'the economy is undercut by a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency.', 'the people of afghanistan seek the promise of a better future.', 'yet once again, weve seen the hope of a new day darkened by violence and uncertainty.so to advance security, opportunity and justice -- not just in kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces -- we need agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers.', 'thats how we can help the afghan government serve its people and develop an economy that isnt dominated by illicit drugs.', 'and thats why im ordering a substantial increase in our civilians on the ground.', 'thats also why we must seek civilian support from our partners and allies, from the united nations and international aid organizations -- an effort that secretary clinton will carry forward next week in the hague.at a time of economic crisis, its tempting to believe that we can shortchange this civilian effort.', 'but make no mistake: our efforts will fail in afghanistan and pakistan if we dont invest in their future.', 'and thats why my budget includes indispensable investments in our state department and foreign assistance programs.', 'these investments relieve the burden on our troops.', 'they contribute directly to security.', 'they make the american people safer.', 'and they save us an enormous amount of money in the long run -- because its far cheaper to train a policeman to secure his or her own village than to help a farmer seed a crop -- or to help a farmer seed a crop than it is to send our troops to fight tour after tour of duty with no transition to afghan responsibility.as we provide these resources, the days of unaccountable spending, no-bid contracts, and wasteful reconstruction must end.', 'so my budget will increase funding for a strong inspector general at both the state department and usaid, and include robust funding for the special inspector generals for afghan reconstruction.and i want to be clear: we cannot turn a blind eye to the corruption that causes afghans to lose faith in their own leaders.', 'instead, we will seek a new compact with the afghan government that cracks down on corrupt behavior, and sets clear benchmarks, clear metrics for international assistance so that it is used to provide for the needs of the afghan people.in a country with extreme poverty thats been at war for decades, there will also be no peace without reconciliation among former enemies.', 'now, i have no illusion that this will be easy.', 'in iraq, we had success in reaching out to former adversaries to isolate and target al qaeda in iraq.', 'we must pursue a similar process in afghanistan, while understanding that it is a very different country.there is an uncompromising core of the taliban.', 'they must be met with force, and they must be defeated.', 'but there are also those whove taken up arms because of coercion, or simply for a price.', 'these afghans must have the option to choose a different course.', 'and thats why we will work with local leaders, the afghan government, and international partners to have a reconciliation process in every province.', 'as their ranks dwindle, an enemy that has nothing to offer the afghan people but terror and repression must be further isolated.', 'and we will continue to support the basic human rights of all afghans -- including women and girls.going forward, we will not blindly stay the course.', 'instead, we will set clear metrics to measure progress and hold ourselves accountable.', 'we’ll consistently assess our efforts to train afghan security forces and our progress in combating insurgents.', 'we will measure the growth of afghanistan’s economy, and its illicit narcotics production.', 'and we will review whether we are using the right tools and tactics to make progress towards accomplishing our goals.none of the steps that ive outlined will be easy; none should be taken by america alone.', 'the world cannot afford the price that will come due if afghanistan slides back into chaos or al qaeda operates unchecked.', 'we have a shared responsibility to act -- not because we seek to project power for its own sake, but because our own peace and security depends on it.', 'and what’s at stake at this time is not just our own security -- its the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security.', 'that was the founding cause of nato six decades ago, and that must be our common purpose today.my administration is committed to strengthening international organizations and collective action, and that will be my message next week in europe.', 'as america does more, we will ask others to join us in doing their part.', 'from our partners and nato allies, we will seek not simply troops, but rather clearly defined capabilities: supporting the afghan elections, training afghan security forces, a greater civilian commitment to the afghan people.', 'for the united nations, we seek greater progress for its mandate to coordinate international action and assistance, and to strengthen afghan institutions.and finally, together with the united nations, we will forge a new contact group for afghanistan and pakistan that brings together all who should have a stake in the security of the region -- our nato allies and other partners, but also the central asian states, the gulf nations and iran; russia, india and china.', 'none of these nations benefit from a base for al qaeda terrorists, and a region that descends into chaos.', 'all have a stake in the promise of lasting peace and security and development.that is true, above all, for the coalition that has fought together in afghanistan, side by side with afghans.', 'the sacrifices have been enormous.', 'nearly 700 americans have lost their lives.', 'troops from over 20 countries have also paid the ultimate price.', 'all americans honor the service and cherish the friendship of those who have fought, and worked, and bled by our side.', 'and all americans are awed by the service of our own men and women in uniform, whove borne a burden as great as any other generation’s.', 'they and their families embody the example of selfless sacrifice.i remind everybody, the united states of america did not choose to fight a war in afghanistan.', 'nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on september 11, 2001, for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives.', 'al qaeda and its allies have since killed thousands of people in many countries.', 'most of the blood on their hands is the blood of muslims, who al qaeda has killed and maimed in far greater number than any other people.', 'that is the future that al qaeda is offering to the people of pakistan and afghanistan -- a future without hope or opportunity; a future without justice or peace.so understand, the road ahead will be long and there will be difficult days ahead.', 'but we will seek lasting partnerships with afghanistan and pakistan that promise a new day for their people.', 'and we will use all elements of our national power to defeat al qaeda, and to defend america, our allies, and all who seek a better future.', 'because the united states of america stands for peace and security, justice and opportunity.', 'that is who we are, and that is what history calls on us to do once

to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.the catalyst for this housing crisis was the fannie and freddie mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in america to collapse.i am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the american dream, but that value will come up.now, we have allocated $750 billion.', 'lets take 300 of that

important first step.', 'and i pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if theyre putting money up.', 'making sure that ceos are not enriching themselves through this process.and i think that its going to take some time to work itself out.', 'but what we havent yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.', 'because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.', 'so ive proposed four specific things that i think can help.number one, lets focus on jobs.', 'i want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company thats creating a job right here in america.number two, lets help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and lets allow them to access their ira accounts without penalty if theyre experiencing a crisis.now sen. mccain and i agree with your idea that weve got to help homeowners.', 'thats why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.i disagree with sen. mccain in how to do it, because the way sen. mccain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if were buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.', 'and we dont want to waste taxpayer money.',

tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.you were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which joe was trying to realize the american dream.now sen. obama talks about the very, very rich.', 'joe, i want to tell you, ill not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and ill keep your taxes low and ill provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.and i will not have -- i will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.', 'fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.', 'thats 16 million jobs in america.', 'and what you want to do to joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the american dream of owning their own business.schieffer: is that what you want to do?mccain: thats what joe believes.obama: he has been watching ads of sen. mccains.', 'let me tell you what im actually going to do.', 'i think tax policy is a major difference between sen. mccain and myself.', 'and we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.now, sen. mccain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in america.', 'exxon mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.what ive said is i want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working americans, 95 percent.', 'if you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.', 'not one dime.and 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut.', 'in fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that i provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than sen. mccain does.now, the conversation i had with joe the plumber, what i essentially said to him was, five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.and what i want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesnt yet have money, i want to give them a tax break now.', 'and that requires us to make some important choices.the last point ill make about small businesses.', 'not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but i also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy.', 'they produce the most jobs.mccain: you know, when sen. obama ended up his conversation with joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.', 'in other words, were going to take joes money, give it to sen. obama, and let him spread the wealth around.i want joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.', 'you told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.the whole premise behind sen. obamas plans are class warfare, lets spread the wealth around.', 'i want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that were talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.who -- why would you want to increase anybodys taxes right now?', 'why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in america, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.im not going to...obama: ok. can i...mccain: were not going to do that in my administration.obama: if i can answer the question.', 'number one, i want to cut taxes for 95 percent of americans.', 'now, it is true that my friend and supporter, warren buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...mccain: were talking about joe the plumber.obama: ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.then exxon mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- theyre trying to figure out how theyre going to afford food, how theyre going to save for their kids college education, they need a break.so, look, nobody likes taxes.', 'i would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.', 'but ultimately, weve got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebodys got to do it.mccain: nobody likes taxes.', 'lets not raise anybodys taxes.', 'ok?obama: well, i dont mind paying a little more.mccain: the fact is that businesses in america today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.', 'our tax rate for business in america is 35 percent.', 'ireland, its 11 percent.where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?we need to cut the business tax rate in america.', 'we need to encourage business.now, of all times in america, we need to cut peoples taxes.', 'we need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.schieffer: all right.', 'lets go to another topic.', 'its related.', 'so if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that.this question goes to you first, sen. obama.we found out yesterday that this years deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion.', 'some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year.both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit.arent you both ignoring reality?', 'wont some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated?give us some specifics on what youre going to cut back.sen.', 'obama?obama: well, first of all, i think its important for the american public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if its structured properly, and, as president, i will make sure its structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and thats important to understand.but there is no doubt that weve been living beyond our means and were going to have to make some adjustments.now, what ive done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut.', 'i havent made a promise about...schieffer: but youre going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly.obama: absolutely.', 'so let me get to that.', 'what i want to emphasize, though, is that i have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go.', 'every dollar that ive proposed, ive proposed an additional cut so that it matches.and some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.', 'it doesnt -- under the medicare plan -- it doesnt help seniors get any better.', 'its not improving our health care system.', 'its just a giveaway.we need to eliminate a whole host of programs that dont work.', 'and i want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that dont work, we should cut.', 'programs that we need, we should make them work better.now, what is true is that sen. mccain and i have a difference in terms of the need to invest in america and the american people.', 'i mentioned health care earlier.if we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on medicare and medicaid in the future.if we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money were borrowing from china to send to saudi arabia.if we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.but what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that were not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.and were going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.schieffer: times up.senator?mccain: well, thank you, bob.', 'i just want to get back to this home ownership.', 'during the depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.and they went out and bought up these mortgages.', 'and people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.and, by the way, this was a proposal made by sen. clinton not too long ago.so, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.schieffer: but what...mccain: but -- ok. all right.schieffer: the question was, what are you going to cut?mccain: energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence.', 'we have to have nuclear power.', 'we have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that dont like us very much.', 'its wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which sen. obama has opposed.and the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in america.ok, what -- what would i cut?', 'i would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, ok?', 'some people say thats a hatchet.', 'thats a hatchet, and then i would get out a scalpel, ok?because weve got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- weve got to have a new direction for this country.', 'we have presided over the largest increase in government since the great society.government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt were giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe china.i know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.', 'i know how to eliminate programs.schieffer: which ones?mccain: i have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.', 'another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.i oppose subsidies for ethanol because i thought it distorted the market and created inflation; sen. obama supported those subsidies.i would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from brazil.i know how to save billions.', 'i saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, dod, and people ended up in jail.but i would fight for a line-item veto, and i would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.', 'sen. obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...schieffer: times up.mccain: ... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown.', 'thats not the way we cut -- well cut out all the pork.schieffer: times up.obama: well, look, i think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.', 'it sounds good.', 'its proposed periodically.', 'it doesnt happen.and, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that dont work at all.', 'there are some programs that are underfunded.', 'and i want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.now, sen. mccain talks a lot about earmarks.', 'thats one of the centerpieces of his campaign.earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.', 'theres no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.', 'but its not going to solve the problem.now, the last thing i think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what were doing going forward.when president bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.', 'it has doubled over the last eight years.obama: and we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.so one of the things that i think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.', 'and, frankly, sen. mccain voted for four out of five of president bushs budgets.weve got to take this in a new direction, thats what i propose as president.schieffer: do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years?', 'you have said previously you thought you could, sen. mccain.mccain: sure i do.', 'and let me tell you...schieffer: you can still do that?mccain: yes.', 'sen. obama, i am not president bush.', 'if you wanted to run against president bush, you should have run four years ago.', 'im going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.sen.', 'obama talks about voting for budgets.', 'he voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year.', 'of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.', 'its completely out of control.the mayor of new york, mayor bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on new york city.', 'theyre doing it all over america because they have to.', 'because they have to balance their budgets.', 'i will balance our budgets and i will get them and i will...schieffer: in four years?mccain: ... reduce this -- i can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.now, look, americans are hurting tonight and theyre angry and i understand that, and they want a new direction.', 'i can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.sen.', 'obama talks about the budgets i voted for.', 'he voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the bush administration proposed.he voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that i opposed.', 'so the fact is, lets look at our records, sen. obama.', 'lets look at it as graded by the national taxpayers union and the citizens against government waste and the other watchdog organizations.i have fought against spending.', 'i have fought against special interests.', 'i have fought for reform.', 'you have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.schieffer: barack.obama: well, theres a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it.', 'first of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that i voted on in the senate was in support of tort reform, which wasnt very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the democratic party.', 'i support...mccain: an overwhelming vote.obama: i support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.', 'doesnt make me popular with the teachers union.', 'i support clean coal technology.', 'doesnt make me popular with environmentalists.', 'so ive got a history of reaching across the aisle.now with respect to a couple of things sen. mccain said, the notion that i voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that sen. mccain keeps on making.even fox news disputes it, and that doesnt happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.', 'so the fact of the matter is that if i occasionally have mistaken your policies for george bushs policies, its because on the core economic issues that matter to the american people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of president bush.now, youve shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and i give you enormous credit for that.', 'but when it comes to economic policies, essentially what youre proposing is eight more years of the same thing.', 'and it hasnt worked.and i think the american people understand it hasnt worked.', 'we need to move in a new direction.schieffer: all right...mccain: let me just say, bob.schieffer: ok. about 30 seconds.mccain: ok. but its very clear that i have disagreed with the bush administration.', 'i have disagreed with leaders of my own party.', 'ive got the scars to prove it.whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the senate for the first time.', 'whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in iraq, which i vigorously opposed.', 'whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on medicare prescription drugs, importation.', 'whether it be fighting for an hmo patients bill of rights.', 'whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 commission.i have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the united states senate.schieffer: all right.mccain: sen. obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isnt very convincing.schieffer: all right.', 'were going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign.', 'both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty.schieffer: sen. obama, your campaign has used words like erratic, out of touch, lie, angry, losing his bearings to describe sen. mccain.sen.', 'mccain, your commercials have included words like disrespectful, dangerous, dishonorable, he lied.', 'your running mate said he palled around with terrorists.are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each others face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?and, sen. mccain, youre first.mccain: well, this has been a tough campaign.', 'its been a very tough campaign.', 'and i know from my experience in many campaigns that, if sen. obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the american people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.when sen. obama was first asked, he said, any place, any time, the way barry goldwater and jack kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at dallas.', 'so i think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.and the fact is, its gotten pretty tough.', 'and i regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.', 'but the fact is that it has taken many turns which i think are unacceptable.one of them happened just the other day, when a man i admire and respect -- ive written about him -- congressman john lewis, an american hero, made allegations that sarah palin and i were somehow associated with the worst chapter in american history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, george wallace.', 'that, to me, was so hurtful.and, sen. obama, you didnt repudiate those remarks.', 'every time theres been an out-of-bounds remark made by a republican, no matter where they are, i have repudiated them.', 'i hope that sen. obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by congressman john lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.so i want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign.', 'this is a tough campaign.', 'and its a matter of fact that sen. obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.', 'and i can prove it.and, sen. obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if i did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didnt keep your word.and when you looked into the camera in a debate with sen. clinton and said, i will sit down and negotiate with john mccain about public financing before i make a decision, you didnt tell the american people the truth because you didnt.and thats -- thats -- thats an unfortunate part.', 'now we have the highest spending by sen. obamas campaign than any time since watergate.schieffer: times up.', 'all right.obama: well, look, you know, i think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.', 'i think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the american people -- bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the american people think that sen. mccain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.and 100 percent, john, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.mccain: its not true.obama: it absolutely is true.', 'and, now, i think the american people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.and there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like were having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.', 'thats the stuff that campaigns should be made of.the notion, though, that because were not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, john, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, i dont mind being attacked for the next three weeks.what the american people cant afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.', 'and what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about whats most pressing to them: the economic crisis.sen.', 'mccains own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.and i would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the american people can send their kids to college.and that is something that i would welcome.', 'but it requires, i think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in america.mccain: well, if youll turn on the television, as i -- i watched the arizona cardinals defeat the dallas cowboys on sunday.obama: congratulations.mccain: every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan.', 'and any objective observer has said its not true.', 'youre running ads right now that say that i oppose federal funding for stem cell research.', 'i dont.youre running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.', 'so the fact is that sen. obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of american politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.and of course, ive been talking about the economy.', 'of course, ive talked to people like joe the plumber and tell him that im not going to spread his wealth around.', 'im going to let him keep his wealth.', 'and of course, were talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in america.thats what my campaign is all about and thats what itll continue to be all about.but again, i did not hear a repudiation of congressman...obama: i mean, look, if we want to talk about congressman lewis, who is an american hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaigns awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like terrorist and kill him, and that youre running mate didnt mention, didnt stop, didnt say hold on a second, thats kind of out of line.and i think congressman lewis point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.now...mccain: youve got to read what he said...(crosstalk)obama: let -- let -- let...mccain: youve got to read what he said.obama: let me -- let me complete...schieffer: go ahead.obama: ... my response.', 'i do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we dont think that comparison is appropriate.and, in fact, afterwards, congressman lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.the important point here is, though, the american people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.', 'and what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and thats what i have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.mccain: i cannot...obama: we can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, john, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...mccain: we do and i hope...obama: ... talking about it this evening.mccain: sure.obama: but when people suggest that i pal around with terrorists, then were not talking about issues.', 'what were talking about...mccain: well, let me just say i would...schieffer: (inaudible)mccain: let me just say categorically im proud of the people that come to our rallies.', 'whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, youre going to have some fringe peoples.', 'you know that.', 'and ive -- and weve always said that thats not appropriate.but to somehow say that group of young women who said military wives for mccain are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say world war ii, vietnam, korea, iraq, im not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and theyre great citizens.and im not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- theres a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, sen. obama, that im not happy about either.in fact, some t-shirts that are very...obama: john, i...mccain: ... unacceptable.', 'so the point is -- the point is that i have repudiated every time someones been out of line, whether theyve been part of my campaign or not, and i will continue to do that.but the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.', 'i havent.obama: well, look, bob, as i said...schieffer: i mean, do you take issue with that?obama: you know, heres what i would say.', 'i mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each others campaigns.', 'i suspect we wont agree here tonight.what i think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that were facing, if were going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the great depression, if we can -- if were going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in america, then democrats, independents and republicans, were going to have to be able to work together.and what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.', 'and it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.', 'what we cant do, i think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.', 'and that has been a culture in washington that has been taking place for too long.', 'and i think...mccain: well, bob, you asked me a direct question.schieffer: short answer, yes, short answer.mccain: yes, real quick.', 'mr. ayers, i dont care about an old washed-up terrorist.', 'but as sen. clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.we need to know the full extent of sen. obamas relationship with acorn, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.', 'the same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for lighting and site selection.', 'so all of these things need to be examined, of course.schieffer: all right.', 'im going to let you respond and well extend this for a moment.obama: bob, i think its going to be important to just -- ill respond to these two particular allegations that sen. mccain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.in fact, mr. ayers has become the centerpiece of sen. mccains campaign over the last two or three weeks.', 'this has been their primary focus.', 'so lets get the record straight.', 'bill ayers is a professor of education in chicago.forty years ago, when i was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.', 'i have roundly condemned those acts.', 'ten years ago he served and i served on a school reform board that was funded by one of ronald reagans former ambassadors and close friends, mr. annenberg.other members on that board were the presidents of the university of illinois, the president of northwestern university, who happens to be a republican, the president of the chicago tribune, a republican- leaning newspaper.mr.', 'ayers is not involved in my campaign.', 'he has never been involved in this campaign.', 'and he will not advise me in the white house.', 'so thats mr. ayers.now, with respect to acorn, acorn is a community organization.', 'apparently what theyve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didnt really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.it had nothing to do with us.', 'we were not involved.', 'the only involvement ive had with acorn was i represented them alongside the u.s. justice department in making illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at dmvs.now, the reason i think that its important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that sen. mccain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.let me tell you who i associate with.', 'on economic policy, i associate with warren buffett and former fed chairman paul volcker.', 'if im interested in figuring out my foreign policy, i associate myself with my running mate, joe biden or with dick lugar, the republican ranking member on the senate foreign relations committee, or general jim jones, the former supreme allied commander of nato.those are the people, democrats and republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the white house.', 'and i think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, sen. mccain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.mccain: well, again, while you were on the board of the woods foundation, you and mr. ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to acorn.', 'so -- and you launched your political campaign in mr. ayers living room.obama: thats absolutely not true.mccain: and the facts are facts and records are records.obama: and thats not the facts.mccain: and its not the fact -- its not the fact that sen. obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.', 'its the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about sen. obamas relationship with them and with acorn and the american people will make a judgment.and my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for america.', 'and thats what my campaign is about and im not going to raise taxes the way sen. obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.', 'and thats really what this campaign is going to be about.schieffer: all right.', 'lets go to the next topic and you -- we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion.', 'i want to ask both of you about the people that youre going to bring into the government.and our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.schieffer: so ill begin by asking both of you this question, and ill ask you to answer first, sen. obama.', 'why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?obama: well, joe biden, i think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.', 'its not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.', 'and democrats and republicans alike, i think, acknowledge his expertise there.but its also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what its like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.and, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.', 'thats what hes done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.thats what hes done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the violence against womens act.', 'joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and i think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.because after eight years of failed policies, he and i both agree that what were going to have to do is to re-prioritize, make sure that were investing in the american people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.so, on the key issues that are of importance to american families, joe bidens always been on the right side, and i think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.schieffer: senator?mccain: well, americans have gotten to know sarah palin.', 'they know that shes a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over america.shes a reformer.', 'she is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor.', 'when she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, this cant go on.shes given money back to the taxpayers.', 'shes cut the size of government.', 'she negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas thats going to relieve the energy needs of the united -- of what they call the lower 48.shes a reformer through and through.', 'and its time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nations capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism thats been so much a part of it that ive fought against for all these years.shell be my partner.', 'she understands reform.', 'and, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.', 'she understands that autism is on the rise, that weve got to find out whats causing it, and weve got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.she understands that better than almost any american that i know.', 'im proud of her.and she has ignited our party and people all over america that have never been involved in the political process.', 'and i cant tell how proud i am of her and her family.her husbands a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.schieffer: do you think shes qualified to be president?obama: you know, i think its -- thats going to be up to the american people.', 'i think that, obviously, shes a capable politician who has, i think, excited the -- a base in the republican party.and i think its very commendable the work shes done on behalf of special needs.', 'i agree with that, john.i do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if were going to get serious in terms of research.', 'that is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.and if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, were not going to be able to do it.', 'thats an example of, i think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that were funding some of those programs.schieffer: do you think sen. biden is qualified?mccain: i think that joe biden is qualified in many respects.', 'but i do point out that hes been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.he voted against the first gulf war.', 'he voted against it and, obviously, we had to take saddam hussein out of kuwait or it wouldve threatened the middle eastern world supply.in iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing iraq into three countries.', 'were seeing iraq united as iraqis, tough, hard, but were seeing them.', 'were now about to have an agreement for status of forces in iraq coming up.there are several issues in which, frankly, joe biden and i open and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and hes been wrong on a number of the major ones.but again, i want to come back to, notice every time sen. obama says, we need to spend more, we need to spend more, thats the answer -- why do we always have to spend more?why cant we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?', 'maybe thats why hes asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise peoples taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the american families.schieffer: lets go to -- lets go to a new topic.', 'were running a little behind.lets talk about energy and climate control.', 'every president since nixon has said what both of you...mccain: climate change.schieffer: climate change, yes -- has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil.when nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil.', 'now, were importing more than 60 percent.would each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term?and i believe the first question goes to you, sen. mccain.mccain: i think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on middle eastern oil and venezuelan oil.', 'canadian oil is fine.by the way, when sen. obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the north american free trade agreement, the canadians said, yes, and well sell our oil to china.you dont tell countries youre going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.we can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away.', 'we can store and we can reprocess.sen.', 'obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.look, weve sailed navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.', 'we can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, sen. obama, no problem.so the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of america thats hurting rather badly.so i think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we dont achieve our independence.schieffer: all right.', 'can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?obama: i think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the middle east or venezuela.', 'i think thats about a realistic timeframe.and this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.', 'obviously, weve got an immediate crisis right now.', 'but nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from china and sending it to saudi arabia.', 'its mortgaging our childrens future.now, from the start of this campaign, ive identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what i think we have to do.number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that theyre not drilling, use them or lose them.and i think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.', 'but understand, we only have three to four percent of the worlds oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil, which means that we cant drill our way out of the problem.thats why ive focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.', 'these have been priorities of mine since i got to the senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car thats built not in japan and not in south korea, but built here in the united states of america.we invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.now i just want to make one last point because sen. mccain mentioned nafta and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.', 'i believe in free trade.', 'but i also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the bush administration with the support of sen. mccain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.', 'and nafta doesnt have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.and what i said was we should include those and make them enforceable.', 'in the same way that we should enforce rules against china manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.and when it comes to south korea, weve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of south korean cars into the united states.', 'thats all good.', 'we can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into south korea.', 'that is not free trade.', 'weve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of american businesses and american workers and i make no apology for that.schieffer: senator?mccain: well, you know, i admire so much sen. obamas eloquence.', 'and you really have to pay attention to words.', 'he said, we will look at offshore drilling.', 'did you get that?', 'look at.', 'we can offshore drill now.', 'weve got to do it now.', 'we will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.', 'its doable.', 'the technology is there and we have to drill now.now, on the subject of free trade agreements.', 'i am a free trader.', 'and i need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.but let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that sen. obama opposes.', 'right now, because of previous agreements, some made by president clinton, the goods and products that we send to colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- theres a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.', 'so sen. obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the colombia free trade agreement.', 'the same country thats helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country thats killing young americans.and also the country that just freed three americans that will help us create jobs in america because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that weve already paid.free trade with colombia is something thats a no-brainer.', 'but maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.obama: let me respond.', 'actually, i understand it pretty well.', 'the history in colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.and what i have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isnt being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, i supported the peruvian free trade agreement which was a well-structured agreement.but i think that the important point is weve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.and the last point ill make, because we started on energy.', 'when i talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.', 'they were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.', 'and now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people cant get car loans.thats why i think its important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.and detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.', 'its going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.if we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across america, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.mccain: well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- sen. obama doesnt want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with hugo chavez, the guy who has been helping farc, the terrorist organization.free trade between ourselves and colombia, i just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of american dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the united states, opening up those markets.so i dont -- i dont think theres any doubt that sen. obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.', 'and the last president of the united states that tried that was herbert hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.were not going to follow that path while im -- when im president of the united states.schieffer: all right, lets go to a new topic, health care.', 'given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage?', 'the question is first to sen. obama.obama: weve got to do both, and thats exactly what my plan does.look, as i travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.', 'just yesterday, i was in toledo shaking some hands in a line.', 'two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.', 'neither of them have health insurance.and they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, theyre worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.so heres what my plan does.', 'if you have health insurance, then you dont have to do anything.', 'if youve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.the only thing were going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.', 'and we estimate we can cut the average familys premium by about $2,500 per year.if you dont have health insurance, then what were going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both sen. mccain and i enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.were going to make sure that insurance companies cant discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.', 'well negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.we are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.and we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.', 'weve got to put more money into preventive care.this will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but its also how were going to save the federal budget, because we cant afford these escalating costs.schieffer: all right.sen.', 'mccain?mccain: well, it is a terribly painful situation for americans.', 'theyre seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.', 'forty-seven million americans are without health insurance in america today.and it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.', 'and i am convinced we need to do a lot of things.we need to put health care records online.', 'the v.a.', 'does that.', 'that will -- that will reduce costs.', 'we need to have more community health centers.', 'we need to have walk-in clinics.the rise of obesity amongst young americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is.', 'we should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.', 'every parent should know whats going on there.we -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.but i want to give every american family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.', 'take it and get anywhere in america the health care that you wish.now, my old buddy, joe, joe the plumber, is out there.', 'now, joe, sen. obamas plan, if youre a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which sen. obama wants, if youre out there, my friend, and youve got employees, and youve got kids, if you dont get -- adopt the health care plan that sen. obama mandates, hes going to fine you.now, sen. obama, id like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and i dont think that joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in americas economy.sen.', 'obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of america through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.if you like that, youll love canada and england.', 'so the point is...schieffer: so thats your objective?obama: it is not and i didnt describe it...mccain: no, you stated it.obama: i just...mccain: excuse me.obama: i just described what my plan is.', 'and im happy to talk to you, joe, too, if youre out there.', 'heres your fine -- zero.', 'you wont pay a fine, because...mccain: zero?obama: zero, because as i said in our last debate and ill repeat, john, i exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.i exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.', 'but large businesses that can afford it, weve got a choice.', 'either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or theyre going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.the average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.so heres what we do.', 'we exempt small businesses.', 'in fact, what, joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, well give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.if you dont have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that i just described.now, what we havent talked about is sen. mccains plan.', 'he says hes going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.', 'that sounds pretty good.', 'and you can go out and buy your own insurance.heres the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.', 'this is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.older folks, lets healthy folks, whats going to end up happening is that youre going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers wont be able to afford it.and once youre out on your own with this $5,000 credit, sen. mccain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.and this is your plan, john.', 'for the first time in history, you will be taxing peoples health care benefits.by the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.', 'so if youve got $5,000 and its going to cost you $12,000, thats a loss for you.last point about sen. mccains plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under sen. mccains plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.that, i think, is a mistake and i think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.schieffer: what about that?mccain: hey, joe, youre rich, congratulations, because what joe wanted to do was buy the business that hes been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take joes money and then you decide what to do with it.now, joe, youre rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where youll have to pay a fine if you dont provide health insurance that sen. obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.thats big government at its best.now, 95 percent of the people in america will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.and the good thing about this is theyll be able to go across america.', 'the average cost of a health care insurance plan in america today is $5,800.', 'im going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.this will give them availability.', 'this will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have sen. obama and government decide that for them.this really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.', 'if you notice that in all of this proposal, senator -- government wants -- sen. obama wants government to do the job.sen.', 'obama wants government to do the job.', 'i want, joe, you to do the job.i want to leave money in your pocket.', 'i want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.', 'thats what im all about.', 'and weve got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.we cant afford that in the next eight years and sen. obama, with the democrats in charge of congress, things have gotten worse.', 'have you noticed, theyve been in charge the last two years.schieffer: all right.', 'a short response.obama: very briefly.', 'you all just heard my plan.', 'if youve got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.', 'now, under sen. mccains plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.thats the choice youll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.', 'and dont take my word for it.', 'the u.s. chamber of commerce, which generally doesnt support a lot of democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.all i want to do, if youve already got health care, is lower your costs.', 'that includes you, joe.schieffer: all right.', 'lets stop there and go to another question.', 'and this one goes to sen. mccain.', 'sen. mccain, you believe roe v. wade should be overturned.', 'sen. obama, you believe it shouldnt.could either of you ever nominate someone to the supreme court who disagrees with you on this issue?', 'sen. mccain?mccain: i would never and have never in all the years ive been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.', 'thats not appropriate to do.schieffer: but you dont want roe v. wade to be overturned?mccain: i thought it was a bad decision.', 'i think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.', 'i think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.', 'im a federalist.', 'and i believe strongly that we should have nominees to the united states supreme court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the united states senate was about to blow up.', 'republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.we got together seven republicans, seven democrats.', 'you were offered a chance to join.', 'you chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, conservative judges.i voted for justice breyer and justice ginsburg.', 'not because i agreed with their ideology, but because i thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.', 'this is a very important issue were talking about.sen.', 'obama voted against justice breyer and justice roberts on the grounds that they didnt meet his ideological standards.', 'thats not the way we should judge these nominees.', 'elections have consequences.', 'they should be judged on their qualifications.', 'and so thats what i will do.i will find the best people in the world -- in the united states of america who have a history of strict adherence to the constitution.', 'and not legislating from the bench.schieffer: but even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?mccain: i would consider anyone in their qualifications.', 'i do not believe that someone who has supported roe v. wade that would be part of those qualifications.', 'but i certainly would not impose any litmus test.schieffer: all right.obama: well, i think its true that we shouldnt apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the american people.and it is true that this is going to be, i think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.', 'it is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and roe versus wade probably hangs in the balance.now i would not provide a litmus test.', 'but i am somebody who believes that roe versus wade was rightly decided.', 'i think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that i think good people on both sides can disagree on.but what ultimately i believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.', 'and i think that the constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldnt be subject to state referendum, any more than our first amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.so this is going to be an important issue.', 'i will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.ill just give you one quick example.', 'sen. mccain and i disagreed recently when the supreme court made it more difficult for a woman named lilly ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.for years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.', 'and when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, its taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didnt know about it until fairly recently.we tried to overturn it in the senate.', 'i supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; john mccain opposed it.i think that its important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.', 'and thats the kind of judge that i want.schieffer: times up.mccain: obviously, that law waved the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.', 'it was a trial lawyers dream.let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.', 'we have to change the culture of america.', 'those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.', 'and its got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman whos facing this terribly difficult decision.sen.', 'obama, as a member of the illinois state senate, voted in the judiciary committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.', 'he voted against that.and then, on the floor of the state senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.then there was another bill before the senate judiciary committee in the state of illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.', 'and then, on the floor of the illinois state senate, he voted present.i dont know how you vote present on some of that.', 'i dont know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in america.', 'and thats his record, and thats a matter of his record.and hell say it has something to do with roe v. wade, about the illinois state senate.', 'it was clear-cut votes that sen. obama voted, i think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream america.schieffer: response?obama: yes, let me respond to this.', 'if it sounds incredible that i would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, thats because its not true.', 'the -- here are the facts.there was a bill that was put forward before the illinois senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine roe v. wade.', 'the fact is that there was already a law on the books in illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice republicans and democrats voted against it.and the illinois medical society, the organization of doctors in illinois, voted against it.', 'their hippocratic oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.with respect to partial-birth abortion, i am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as theres an exception for the mothers health and life, and this did not contain that exception.and i attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.', 'and that was rejected, and thats why i voted present, because im willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.the last point i want to make on the issue of abortion.', 'this is an issue that -- look, it divides us.', 'and in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.but there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, we should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.those are all things that we put in the democratic platform for the first time this year, and i think thats where we can find some common ground, because nobodys pro-abortion.', 'i think its always a tragic situation.we should try to reduce these circumstances.schieffer: lets give sen. mccain a short response...mccain: just again...schieffer: ... and then...mccain: just again, the example of the eloquence of sen. obama.', 'hes health for the mother.', 'you know, thats been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in america to mean almost anything.thats the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, health.', 'but, look, cindy and i are adoptive parents.', 'we know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.', 'well do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.but that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.', 'of course, we have to come together.', 'of course, we have to work together, and, of course, its vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that well help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and well help take care of it.schieffer: lets stop there, because i want to get in a question on education and im afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.the question is this: the u.s. spends more per capita than any other country on education.', 'yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.the implications of this are clearly obvious.', 'some even say it poses a threat to our national security.do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?the question to sen. obama first.obama: this probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because theres never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.so weve got to get our education system right.', 'now, typically, whats happened is that theres been a debate between more money or reform, and i think we need both.in some cases, we are going to have to invest.', 'early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.i think its going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.and i think its important for us to make college affordable.', 'right now, i meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if theyre going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and its very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that theyre going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.and thats why ive proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether its military service, whether its peace corps, whether its working in a community.if we do those things, then i believe that we can create a better school system.but theres one last ingredient that i just want to mention, and thats parents.', 'we cant do it just in the schools.', 'parents are going to have to show more responsibility.', 'theyve got to turn off the tv set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.schieffer: sen. mccain?mccain: well, its the civil rights issue of the 21st century.', 'theres no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in america after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.but what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?so choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements thats already been proven in places in like new orleans and new york city and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.and we find bad teachers another line of work.', 'and we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that sen. obama and mrs. obama had and cindy and i had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.charter schools arent the only answer, but theyre providing competition.', 'they are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.', 'you will find that some of the worst school systems in america get the most money per student.so i believe that we need to reward these good teachers.we need to encourage programs such as teach for america and troops to teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.look, we must improve education in this country.', 'as far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.', 'we need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.', 'we need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.', 'and we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.schieffer: do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools?', 'and i mean, more federal money?obama: well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and thats a tradition that has served us well.', 'but i do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.now we tried to do this under president bush.', 'he put forward no child left behind.', 'unfortunately, they left the money behind for no child left behind.', 'and local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.so what i want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.', 'sen. mccain and i actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.charter schools, i doubled the number of charter schools in illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.', 'i think its important to foster competition inside the public schools.and we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they cant hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.', 'and i also have to disagree on sen. mccains record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didnt seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we cant give money to every interest group that comes along.i dont think americas youth are interest groups, i think theyre our future.', 'and this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.', 'we cant say were going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how were going to pay for it.and if were going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.', 'its not going to happen on its own.schieffer: what about that, senator?mccain: well, sure.', 'im sure youre aware, sen. obama, of the program in the washington, d.c., school system where vouchers are provided and theres a certain number, i think its a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.because they wanted to have the same choice that you and i and cindy and your wife have had.', 'and that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.and we all know the state of the washington, d.c., school system.', 'that was vouchers.', 'that was voucher, sen. obama.', 'and im frankly surprised you didnt pay more attention to that example.now as far as the no child left behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.', 'it had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in america from a nationwide perspective.', 'and we need to fix a lot of the problems.', 'we need to sit down and reauthorize it.but, again, spending more money isnt always the answer.', 'i think the head start program is a great program.', 'a lot of people, including me, said, look, its not doing what it should do.', 'by the third grade many times children who were in the head start program arent any better off than the others.lets reform it.', 'lets reform it and fund it.', 'that was, of course, out-of-bounds by the democrats.', 'we need to reform these programs.', 'we need to have transparency.', 'we need to have rewards.', 'its a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.and i just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism.', 'sarah palin knows about that better than most.', 'and well find and well spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.', 'and well care for these young children.', 'and all americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.but to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the united states of america also means that it cries out for reform, as well.and i will support those reforms, and i will fund the ones that are reformed.', 'but im not going to continue to throw money at a problem.', 'and ive got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.', 'and its been proven.obama: ill just make a quick comment about vouchers in d.c. sen. mccains absolutely right: the d.c. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.', 'and weve got a wonderful new superintendent there whos working very hard with the young mayor there to try...mccain: who supports vouchers.obama: ... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.mccain: she supports vouchers, also.obama: but the -- but heres the thing, is that, even if sen. mccain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- i disagree with him on this, because the data doesnt show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of sen. mccains education policy is to increase the voucher program in d.c. by 2,000 slots.that leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from sen. mccain.so if we are going to be serious about this issue, weve got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.', 'and thats what i intend to do as president.schieffer: all right.mccain: because theres not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldnt do it, even though its working.', 'i got it.schieffer: all right.gentlemen, we have come to the close.', 'before i ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, id like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to mydebates.org, where you will find this evenings debates and the three that preceded tonights debate.now, for the final statements, by a coin toss, sen. mccain goes first.mccain: well, thank you again, bob.thanks to hofstra.and its great to be with you again.', 'i think weve had a very healthy discussion.my friends, as i said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for america.', 'and they were graphically demonstrated again today.america needs a new direction.', 'we cannot be satisfied with what weve been doing for the last eight years.i have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an hmo patients bill of rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 commission, i have a long record of it.and ive been a careful steward of your tax dollars.', 'we have to make health care affordable and available.', 'we have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.we have to stop the spending.', 'we have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your childrens futures.all of these things and all the promises and commitments that sen. obama and i made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure america is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.thats why ive asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.ive spent

life, and ive been proud to serve.and i hope youll give me an opportunity to serve again.', 'id be honored and humbled.schieffer: senator?obama: well, i want to thank sen. mccain and bob for moderating.i think we all know america is going through tough times right now.', 'the policies of the last eight years and -- and washingtons unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the great depression.and thats why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that weve seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.we need fundamental change in this country, and thats what id like to bring.you know, over the last 20 months, youve invited me into

businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.', 'in policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.these are the policies i have fought for my entire career.', 'and these are the policies i want to bring to the white house.but its not going to be easy.', 'its not going to be quick.', 'it is going to be requiring all of us -- democrats, republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.im absolutely convinced we can do it.', 'i would ask for your vote, and i promise you that if you give me the

hospitalizations.', 'while healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect americans into april – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.as part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza a, called h3n2.', 'it was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season.', 'moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, h3n2.as such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the h3n2 strain and what we can do about it.', 'by looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.these lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required.', 'with this statement, i want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against h3n2there are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against h3n2.', 'we’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against h3n2.', 'overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) for h3n2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.while that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against h3n2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against h3n2.', 'of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against h3n2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower.', 'the vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season.', 'the data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for h1n1 and influenza b was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.so why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against h3n2?', 'and why have vaccines in prior seasons when h3n2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?we don’t think it was a question of getting the particular h3n2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines.', 'although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including h3n2.however, we’re working with our colleagues at cdc and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza.', 'we would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against h3n2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.working to determine the root causestoward these ends, scientists at fda are collaborating with colleagues at centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness.', 'this work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal.', 'we’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines.', 'the adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines.', 'what we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against h3n2 was lagging.what might this information reveal?', 'one theory is that people might require a higher amount of h3n2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza.', 'as i noted previously, the work conducted with cms shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine.', 'we are working to follow up on that finding.', 'we’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against h3n2.', 'our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.the knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonwhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an fda advisory committee meeting march 1, 2018. as is done every year, the fda convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the world health organization (who) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere, and to help the fda select strains for next season’s flu vaccines in the u.s. who has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this year’s influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere.', 'the upcoming fda advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the u.s. following that meeting, the fda will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this year’s flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu.in the meantime, this flu season isn’t over yet, though cdc data shows a decline in visits to doctor’s offices and outpatient clinics.', 'we must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick.', 'it’s also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by h1n1 and b influenza for which vaccines offer better protection.', 'vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick.', 'people who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs.the fda remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this season’s flu vaccine against h3n2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development.', 'our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination.the fda, an agency within the u.s. department of

structures, including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships.', 'for tax purposes, such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay tax at rates that reach 39.6 percent under current law.saying the current system “stifles small businesses,” the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them.', 'trump also has proposed a top income

faster pace.', 'but i think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis.', 'the scars ran very deep.', 'devastating damage.', 'its going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this.', 'but were making progress.tapper: in 2009 when president obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for.', 'this time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt.republicans on capitol hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts.given the fact that were going to be -- were going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment.', 'isnt it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so were not just laying this burden on our future generations?geithner: i dont think so.', 'in a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep.', 'with this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, its appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.tapper: many of the details on the wall street reform bill that president obama just signed will be determined by regulators.', 'in fact, the bill also gives more power to some regulators, some of the same ones who failed us the last time around.why should we be confident that theyre going to get it right either with the rule making or next time theres a crisis?geithner: excellent question.', 'but actually, the theory, the basic strategy in this reform bill does not rest on the wisdom of regulators.', 'it does two very important things, though.', 'itll help consumers make better choices with better disclosure, much more clarity about the terms of the credit card contract or mortgage loan so they get better protection against the risk of being taken advantage of.but it also gives authority we did not have to put in place strong constraints on risk taking on all the nations largest institutions.', 'that authority did not exist before and it was central to what caused the near collapse of the financial system.tapper: will these powers have allowed you, if had been secretary of treasury at the time or your predecessor hank paulsen to have staved off the financial crisis?geithner: i dont think theres any reform bill, no law in any country that can prevent all financial crises.', 'but if we had had this authority as a country, it -- we would have been able to limit risk taking and deal with the trauma that came from the stakes these firms made much more easily.', 'it would have caused much less damage.', 'it would have been much less severe, caused much less damage to the basic fortunes americans and businesses across the country and to our -- and our long term fiscal position.tapper: you eluded to the consumer financial protection bureau that was created.', 'many liberals and labor unions and consumer groups say theres one person they want for that job.', 'elizabeth warren.', 'the woman who thought it up.do you support that idea?geithner: she is a enormously effective advocate for reform.', 'probably the most effective advocate for reform for consumers for consumer protection in the country.', 'she has huge credibility and she played a decisive role in helping make the public case for reform and she was early on this, way ahead of everybody else.tapper: 2007 she wrote that -- that -- she came up with that idea.geithner: and even before that she was pointing out to people the risks of whats happening in the housing market and credit market.', 'so she has enormous credibility and shed be an excellent leader of that institution.', 'but thats a decision the presidents going to make.tapper: some in the white house say that -- that youve had concerns about her appointment because she shes been a sharp critic of you, shes been a sharp critic of treasury department policies.', 'do you have concerns?geithner: i dont have concerns and i should say in that context that she has been playing a very important role in providing oversight over the programs we put in place to break the back of this financial crisis.', 'you know, put out this financial fire.tapper: ken feinberg issued a report including that u.s. banks paid out $1.6 billion in unwanted -- unwarranted bonuses to top earners during the height of the meltdown.', 'seventeen banks made these payouts after getting tarp funds, after getting bailout funds.geithner: its a -- you know, it really is an incredible thing.', 'and thats what he reminded of which is in early 09, on the basis of performance in 08, in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the great depression, firms that had taken support from the government because they could not manage without it still paid out substantial sums of money to people who made the decisions that caused the crisis.tapper: is there nothing that can be done about this?geithner: well, you know, he spoke to that earlier this week.', 'what he did do, though, and this was enormously effective was he went and used the authority he had to change behavior going forward.', 'so you didnt have taxpayers money after he had that authority go to enrich the people that had brought the system to the edge of collapse.now, what hes also done and what our responsibility is to make sure these firms can never again go back to paying their executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the country as a whole, the economy as a whole.', 'so, hes done a great job.', 'very tough judgments.', 'limited authority in some cases, but he uses authority very well.tapper: why is it that u.s. automakers when they received bailout funds had to take serious steps to take -- what are called haircuts?', 'salary reductions, layoffs.', 'and banks didnt.', 'banks -- i mean, you had ken feinberg supervising their salaries as long as they were receiving tarp money, but then they paid the money back and did whatever they wanted.', 'how come banks didnt have to do that?geithner: great question.', 'and thats why we have financial reform.', 'because we had for the country as a whole, a process of bankruptcy for dealing with failure.', 'we did not have a similar process that could deal with the failure of large financial institutions.that was a tragic failure for the country because what it meant is when firms like aig or lehman or bear stearns manage themselves to the point where they could not survive without the government, we had no tools like bankruptcy to force them to restructure and protect the taxpayer from losses.', 'but what this financial reform will do is to give us that authority.', 'a type of bankruptcy regime that we can use for these large institutions because, again, this is a basic commitment in the bill.', 'banks should be paying for the cost of bank failures.', 'we dont want the taxpayers paying for the cost of bank failures.', 'and we should have the ability to dismember them, put them out of existence, put them out of their misery without it causing catastrophic damage to the economy as a whole.tapper: the treasury department issued a currency report and concluded that china was not manipulating its currency.', 'very few legislators on capitol hill seem to agree with that report, and im wondering if you agree with it.geithner: well, what china did, and this is the important thing, after a long period of pegging their currency to the dollar, holding their currency constant against the dollar, they have now started to allow it to move upward again to appreciate, to strengthen their response to market forces.now, of course, they just started that process.', 'its just the beginning, and what matters to us and to all of chinas trading partners is that they let that currency appreciate, as they did the last time they allowed us to move.', 'what matters to us is how fast and how far they let it go.tapper: but you stand by the idea, stand by the assertion, that china is not manipulating its currency?geithner: oh, absolutely.', 'but again, they begin the process of letting it start to reflect market forces.', 'thats very good for china.', 'its very good for the united states.tapper: lastly, this has been an odd week for the obama administration -- not necessarily for the treasury department, but for the obama administration, given the whole kerfuffle with shirley sherrod and the agriculture department.', 'president obama has said this is a teaching moment for him and his administration.', 'secretary vilsack said something similar.did you learn anything from watching your colleagues go through this?geithner: well, as the president said, i think you saw a general rush to judgment everywhere -- in the press and outside the press.', 'and i think i agree with it -- its something that we should all take some caution from and look at these things carefully.', 'but he spoke to that, i thought, well earlier this week.tapper: secretary geithner, thanks so much for joining us.geithner: thanks, jake.tapper: and joining me now is someone who also knows from budget challenges, new jerseys republican governor, chris christie.', 'governor, thank you so much.', 'welcome to this week.christie: im happy to be here.tapper: so, governor, your victory last november in the very blue state of new jersey was heralded by republicans nationally, seen as a blueprint for their victories.', 'now, a lot of republicans who wanted you to win and admired your campaign said that you won mainly by criticizing incumbent democratic governor corzine, not necessarily by a specific, detailed agenda.and im wondering if, first of all, you agree with that.', 'and, second of all, how do you see your victory in the context of what republicans can do this november?christie: well, first off, jake, i think what we did in new jersey last year was say very specifically what direction we wanted to take the state in.', 'we said we wanted to have less spending, smaller government, lower taxes, and commonsense regulation that was going to help to grow private-sector jobs.and so i didnt go line item by line item through the budget during a campaign, and i didnt think it was the right thing to do.now, in terms of what it tells us going forward, i think republicans across the country need to get back to our brand, and i think that is the republican brand.', 'its why i became a republican: less government, lower taxes, less spending, and commonsense regulation that grows private-sector jobs.and so i think if my win tells anything, it means if we get back to basics as republicans, then we speak to some of the concerns people have in new jersey and across the country.tapper: you know, the biggest item on your agenda so far has been dealing with the budget and the huge deficit in new jersey.', 'here you are on cnbc.', '(begin video clip)christie: we passed a budget that cuts $11 billion from our states budget, balances it without any new tax increases on the people of the state of new jersey.', '(end video clip)tapper: now, patrick murray, director of polling at monmouth university, says, quote, thats a nice talking point, but its absolutely untrue.', 'there are a lot of legal obligations that the state has that the governor just simply ignored.', 'and the star-ledger reported, budget analysts say the $11 billion deficit was closed largely by avoiding massive costs.', 'the budget skipped a $3.1 billion payment to the pension fund, continuing a decade-long pattern christie had criticized, and did not pay $1.7 billion to schools under the states formula for education aid.so these billions that youre not funding, are you doing this just by executive fiat?', 'how does this work?', 'because theyre legal obligations, right?christie: no, listen, the legislature passed this budget.', 'the budget i presented on march 16th has $11 billion in less spending than was projected to be done through the corzine administration.and so patrick murray is a pollster, and hes ok as a pollster, but hes not going to be all that great as a governor, because what we did here was we took $1.7 billion less in education funding.', 'well, a billion of that was federal stimulus money that had been spent in one year by the corzine administration, and we were left with $1 billion hole.', 'really what we did was we reduced it by about $820 million in educational spending.across the board, jake, we had to reduce spending.', 'every department of state government was cut.', 'and so there are going to be some cuts you make you like and some that you like less, but when you have an $11 billion hole to fill, you have to fill it.finally, on pensions, i wasnt going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system.', 'we need pension reform.', 'i passed some already for new hires in march, and now this fall were going to go after current employees and pension reform and health benefit reform because were going broke.tapper: now, one -- in that clip, you said that there were no new tax increases on people of the state of new jersey, but also your budget did not fund $1 billion in direct property tax rebates, the homestead rebate.', 'that means that peoples property taxes are going to go up.christie: well, no, what we did, jake, was we did a couple of things.', 'first, we changed it from a property tax rebate program to a direct credit.', 'we spent about $20 million a year in processing these checks and borrowing the money to send out to people.', 'weve eliminated that.and what we did was we skipped three-quarters of that payment in the current fiscal year as part of the shared sacrifice that everybody was going to have to make.', 'i wasnt going to cut just programs for the vulnerable; i wasnt going to cut just programs for the rich, but programs for the middle class.', 'everything had to be cut.but that program will be back as a direct tax credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 11.tapper: now, that shared sacrifice -- i mean, is that not a tax increase, even if its a -- i mean, if youre -- if youre taking away a tax rebate, even temporarily, thats a tax increase, isnt it?christie: no, i dont -- i dont see it that way.', 'and in addition, what we did was were giving the tools now to municipalities with a 2 percent property tax cap that we passed this july by me calling the legislature back into special session and with the tools that were going to be passing this fall for them to cut spending even more at the municipal level so that people are not going to see a huge increase over the course of the next four years in their property taxes at all.tapper: ok, theres been a lot of tension between you and teachers, as youve been wielding your budget ax.', 'heres one example from a recent town hall meeting.', '(begin video clip)(unknown): youre not compensating me for my education and youre not compensating me for my experience.', 'thats...christie: well, you know what?', 'then you dont have to do it.', '(unknown): teachers do it because they love it.', 'thats the only reason i do it.christie: thats good.', 'well, then -- well, and you -- and, listen, and teachers go into knowing what the pay scale is.', '(end video clip)tapper: i know you said your issue is with teachers unions and not with individual teachers, but what do you say to residents of your state who say that they like your stance on taking on the teachers unions, but a clip like that makes it seems like you dont really respect the teaching profession.christie: well, i do respect the teaching profession.', 'im a product of the public schools in the state of new jersey, and i care deeply about our public education.but heres what we cant have any longer: we cant have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession at the cost to the people who have been hurt by the recession the most.for instance, the building trade unions in our state, they have unemployment at 35 percent to 50 percent.', 'theyre getting no raises.', 'theyre getting no benefits any longer, yet their property taxes continue to go up to pay for 4 percent and 5 percent salary increases demanded by the teachers unions in a 0 percent inflation world and that most of the teachers in new jersey, because of their unions, pay nothing towards their health benefits from the day theyre hired until the day they die.now, i have to tell you, jake, we cant have one set of rules for one small sector -- the public sector unions -- and a different set of rules for everyone whos being hurt by this recession and say that those people are being hurt the most by the recession.', 'by the way, you pay for this special treatment.i mean, now, that may be tough talk to people, and its direct, but candidly, thats what we have to do if we want to get budgets under control in new jersey and around the country.tapper: youre -- youve been known in the statehouse and nationally for a blunt style.', 'heres an example of that.', '(begin video clip)christie: like it or not, you guys are stuck with me for four years, and im going to say things directly.', 'when you ask me questions, im going to answer them directly, straightly, bluntly, and nobody in new jersey is going to have to wonder where i am on an issue.', '(end video clip)tapper: thats a high bar, so lets do it.', 'directly, straightly, bluntly, should new jersey join the lawsuit that other states have filed against the obama administration over the individual mandate in the health care reform bill?christie: i have both my attorney general and my commissioner of health studying two things: first, what are the chances of succeeding in the lawsuit?', 'because with limited resources in new jersey, im not going to throw good money after bad.', 'and, secondly, whats the effect of this 2,000-page bill going to be on the people of new jersey?', 'when i get answers back from them, ill make a decision.tapper: whats your impulse?christie: i dont have an impulse.', 'im waiting to get briefed on it.tapper: immigration reform.', 'youve said this issue is too important to demagogue.', 'who is demagoguing in the senate right now?', 'and what is the solution to immigration reform?christie: well, first of all, on demagoguing, i wasnt talking about anything thats going on now.', 'thats a 2-year-old quote, and there were some things going on in new jersey at the time while i was u.s. attorney that i thought was demagoguery, and i called it that.listen, this issue is a federal issue that should be handled by the feds and should be fixed finally.', 'as a former united states attorney, i had to deal with these issues for seven years, and we simply didnt have the resources to deal with them effectively.so the president and the congress have to step up to the plate, they have to secure our borders, and they have to put forward a commonsense path to citizenship for people.and until they do that, states are going to struggle all over the country with this problem, and so is federal law enforcement, who doesnt have the resources to do it effectively.tapper: is the republican party in congress been a help or hindrance to that cause for immigration reform?christie: i think it depends on which republican youre talking about.', 'i dont think the party has had a generalized stance.', 'i think theres been, you know, folks who have been all over the map on this issue.', 'and, candidly, i dont think theres one general republican position.tapper: well, there are democrats offering a bill, and they cant -- they cant get any republicans to join them.christie: well, listen, the fact of the matter is that they have to find a way to build consensus.', 'and i think thats what the president said he wanted to do when he came to town, and i think thats the challenge for those who are in the majority: find a way to build consensus.thats what ive been doing in new jersey, jake.', 'we have a democratic legislature.', 'ive passed a budget with those $11 billion in cuts with a democratic legislature, a property tax cap with a democratic legislature, pension reforms with a democratic legislature.if you want to lead and build consensus, you can, and its on the obligation of those people in charge to build consensus.tapper: two more quick questions.', 'one, the stimulus bill.', 'net positive for new jersey or negative?christie: i think short-term positive, and were now feeling the negative.tapper: lastly, i know you like to talk about new jerseys cultural icons.', 'you prefer to talk about springsteen, but the new york times today has this profile of snooki from jersey shore.christie: sure.tapper: mtvs jersey shore, positive for new jersey or negative?christie: negative for new jersey, i mean, because it -- what it does is it takes a bunch of new yorkers, who are -- most of the people on jersey shore are new yorkers -- takes a bunch of new yorkers, drops them at the jersey shore, and tries to make america feel like this is new jersey.i could tell people, they want to know what new jersey really is?', 'i welcome them to come to new jersey any time.', 'the jersey shore is a beautiful place, and its a place that everybody should come on vacation this summer.', 'weve got another six weeks or so of summer left.', 'come to new jersey.tapper: governor christie, thanks so much for -- for sharing your views.christie: thank you, jake.tapper: the roundtable is next with sam donaldson, cokie roberts, donna brazile, and stephen hayes.', 'and later, the sunday funnies.', '(commercial break)(begin video clip)oreilly: department of agriculture official shirley sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing.', 'ms. sherrod must resign immediately.sherrod: i was faced with having to help a white person save their land, so i didnt give him the full force of what i could do.', '(unknown): the full speech has been released by the naacp, and it backs up ms. sherrods version.tapper: apparently shes watching this briefing, shirley sherrod, on cnn right now.', 'is there anything you want to say to her?gibbs: on behalf of the administration, i offer our apologies.vilsack: i asked for shirleys forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me.', '(unknown): he jumped the gun.sherrod: to have people think that i was a racist really, really hurt.', '(end video clip)tapper: laffaire sherrod, one of the many topics well talk about on our roundtable today with stephen hayes from the weekly standard and fox news channel, donna brazile, the democratic strategist and our dear friend, and abc news own sam donaldson, and, of course, cokie roberts.thanks, all of you, for being here.well get to sherrod in a second, but first i just want to talk a little bit about the geithner interview.', 'secretary geithner said he hopes there isnt going to be much of a fight over trying to keep the tax cuts for the lower income, under $200,000, $250,000 for a family, but repeal them or let them expire for wealthier americans.', 'is there going to be a fight?hayes: yes, hope will only take you so far.', 'i think there will be a fight, and i think one of the main constituencies in the fight is going to be moderate democrats, as you pointed out in your questioning of him.i think youre going to see moderate democrats who walk back from the administrations eagerness to see this tax hike on what theyre calling the wealthiest americans.tapper: donna?brazile: the 2011 budget anticipates that we can close the deficit largely by allowing the bush tax cuts to expire.', 'i think the president should not get into the argument should he, should he not, but rather to present a series of -- a new tax package.', 'dont call it bush tax cuts, but a new tax package that is aimed toward the middle class, towards small businesses, that will close tax loopholes, and to ensure that the -- whatever package we put forward is fiscally prudent, its paid for, and that it helps spur economic growth.tapper: sam, where do you think this is going?donaldson: well, of course, they should continue those tax cuts for 95 percent, as secretary geithner said.', 'and as far as the wealthy are concerned to go from 35 percent as the top rate before the deductions to 39 percent is not going to kill them.', 'it really wont.', 'theyre going to have something to eat the next day.but heres my proposal.', 'there is a point...tapper: a proposal from sam donaldson.donaldson: heres my proposal.', '(unknown): i like that.donaldson: there is a point that at this moment perhaps we should continue to extend the tax cuts across the board, but put in a trigger.', 'when our national product gets better, when our unemployment gets better, use some other indexes.', 'then the trigger automatically raises it for the wealthy back to 39 percent.roberts: triggers never work.', 'weve put in triggers -- congress puts in triggers all the time.', 'its basically fig leaves, and then they dont -- they dont ever do it.donaldson: the reason it doesnt work, cokie, is that congress doesnt follow through.roberts: thats my point.donaldson: i dont think theres a chance that republicans would agree with my modest suggestion.', '(crosstalk)roberts: ... look, its obviously not just an economic question.', 'its a political question.', 'and -- and who gets to frame it?', 'do the democrats get to say the republicans claim that theyre against the deficit, but they want to keep in all these tax cuts for those really rich people, including those wall street bankers who got those huge bonuses, or do the republicans say, look, here are democrats going at you again, raising your taxes just so they can -- just so they can raise that spending, because they want the government to take over every -- every part of american life?and i think thats a lot of what this debate will be framed around and what this election will be framed around.tapper: and this debate comes as ben bernanke, the fed chair, is calling the economic outlook unusually uncertain, which is chilling words for some people.roberts: including the market.', 'i mean, he said those words and 200 points down.donaldson: the market is beginning to start to levitate again, maybe unwisely, but europe has produced better numbers just this past week.', 'the earnings season looks really good for some of the big companies, not just the banks, but some of the companies, caterpillar, some of the people who make things.', 'i think were going to come out of it.hayes: but the numbers are mixed.', 'i mean, thats the rosy scenario.', '(crosstalk)hayes: the numbers are mixed, and there are plenty of numbers that are pointing in the other direction.', 'i think if you look at the big picture, the question i think facing -- facing sort of everybody in washington right now with respect to the tax cuts, one of the things that surprised me most about your interview with tim geithner was that he said raising taxes on the wealthiest americans wont have a negative effect on growth, that was a stunning statement to me.i think you could poll 1,000 economists and find very few of them who would agree with what tim geithner just said, and one of those people is christina romer in the white house, who has written before about the negative effects of tax cuts, and, in fact, has an article...(crosstalk)roberts: of tax increases.hayes: ... of tax increases, and has an article in the current american economic review, june 2010, in which she says tax increases have a large and substantial negative effect on consumption and growth.roberts: now, they have to be really especially careful about the estate tax, however, because...donaldson: there is none.roberts: well, there isnt one at the moment.tapper: theres not right now.', 'and the heirs of george steinbrenner are happy for that.roberts: exactly.', 'so then if they bring it back, theyd better do it overnight, you know, so that people arent doing in their parents in anticipation.tapper: donna, you wanted to say something?brazile: everyone is concerned about the deficit, and thats why we have to be careful how we frame this.', 'i mean, you and i both know that -- stephen, that over the last 10 years weve seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown.', 'meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, theyve seen their wages stagnate.so i think the president needs to be wise enough to take a look at the entire array of tax cuts that he could provide to small businesses and middle-income individuals that will help spur economic growth.roberts: but, of course, the one number that matters is the unemployment number.', 'i mean, that is the number that everybody really cares about.', 'and -- and the president himself is now saying, again, expected to get to 8 percent or lower until maybe the end of 2012.and that -- you know, that then becomes not only a dampening -- have a dampening effect on the economy, but that becomes...(crosstalk)donaldson: there are two commissions...roberts: ... political problem.donaldson: ... running right now, the presidential commission appointed and a private one with pete domenici and alice rivlin that are looking at this problem of our debt and our economic situation, and both of them say, by the end of the year when they report, were going to be stunned by the projections for this country if we dont start cutting unnecessary expenses and getting hold of the debt.roberts: well...tapper: its not just unnecessary expenses.', 'some of them are necessary expenses.', 'its medicare and social security.', '(crosstalk)donaldson: ... building a second engine for a fighter that the defense department says is unnecessary?roberts: well, you know perfectly well, sam, that that doesnt save you any money.', 'i mean, you start...donaldson: oh, a few billion.roberts: you could close down this capitol or turn it into condos and you could close down every domestic program that we have and youd still have a deficit because of social security, medicare...donaldson: thats defense spending.roberts: ... and interest on the national debt.brazile: and the loss of revenues.', 'i mean, this recession has taken a bite out of the economy.', 'were not collecting money, so we need to...(crosstalk)roberts: particularly on capital gains.brazile: thats right.hayes: which -- which is why the single most important thing the government can do right now is get out of the way of private-sector growth.', 'and raising taxes in a recession on whomever is, i think, one of the most foolish things you could possibly do at this time.and, look, the administration implicitly buys the argument that raising taxes in a recession is a bad idea.', 'youve heard administration officials articulate this before, and its behind what they did in the original stimulus with the tax cuts.', '(crosstalk)donaldson: so sign on to the idea that now its a bad idea, but at some point were going to come out of this recession.tapper: well, there is -- and there are voices in the administration...(crosstalk)donaldson: ... and now they raised them, ok?tapper: ... talking about -- there are people in the administration talking about maybe just keeping the bush tax cuts in place for everyone for a year longer...roberts: well, thats what you were saying.tapper: ... or not, but geithner said no.donaldson: but a trigger.', 'otherwise the congress will never come back and say...(crosstalk)hayes: ... have the same debate -- have the same debate in two years.brazile: im going to be like the republicans for 30 seconds.', 'how do we pay for it?', 'how do we pay for it?', 'we know that the bush tax cuts is one of the driving forces...(crosstalk)hayes: it is -- it is part of it, but thats on static scoring.', 'if you look at what it does for economic growth, you could argue that youll make up some of the revenues...brazile: so how many jobs were created during its period when we had the bush tax cuts, from 2001 to 2008?', 'how many jobs?hayes: i dont -- i dont know the number.brazile: hardly any.', 'we lost jobs.', 'thats the point.', 'the point is, we should have tax cuts that help spur economic growth.', 'bottom line, its about jobs, jobs, jobs.roberts: i think thats right.', 'the question is, what cuts?', 'and not just cuts.', 'and i think that...hayes: sure, ok. lets say that small business is the engine for job growth.brazile: i agree with that.hayes: but the people that were talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners.', 'so if youre talking about cutting taxes for people who can...donaldson: most of the wealthy...hayes: ... put people back to work, thats who youre talking about.', '(crosstalk)donaldson: ... most of the wealthy, the top 3 percent are small-business owners?', 'wrong.', 'there are some, yes, of course.brazile: its less than a quarter.donaldson: come on, stephen.tapper: we can have politifact come in and weigh in on that one.brazile: they will.', 'trust me.tapper: i do want -- i do want to move to the subject of the unemployed.', 'and by the unemployed, i mean shirley sherrod, who is the most notable unemployed person in america right now.', 'the white house says they had nothing to do with it, but shirley sherrod on cnn, after speaking to president obama, said she wasnt so sure.', '(begin video clip)sherrod: i firmly believe that someone in the white house was telling them that the white house wanted me to resign.', '(end video clip)tapper: now, donna, the white house

realign the military for the 21st century, paul wrote.', 'it seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of

mounted on an armored vehicle.', 'the pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.”when you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction

percent; in february, it dropped 50 percent.', 'and in the first three months are down a total of 50 homicides, 42 percent.', 'so its a very significant drop and one of the most -- march was one of the biggest one-month drops in the history of the city of chicago.second is, its, you know, people in the city of chicago, there are gun purchases done in indiana, brought over.', 'so you need a uniform policy on gun control.', 'as ive always said, it comes down to the four ps.and its not one of them; its all of them: policing, and so being strategic about your police resources where you apply them; smart prevention, like after school programs and summer jobs to make sure kids have a positive thing to do and are out of harms way; stiffer penalties, like a three-year minimum for gun crimes, first prevent people from getting guns -- criminals, second if the criminals commit the crimes theres swift punishment; and fourth p is sound parenting, teaching kids right from wrong.and all

to indiana where a lot of purchases are made before the gun ends up in the city of chicago.', 'so you have to be smart about it.you have to -- you have to have stiff gun control laws.', 'and i believe firmly in preventing criminals getting access to them.', 'but you have to focus on every one of those aspects that, in my view, have a policy that makes sure that you have police on the street, getting kids, guns and drugs off the streets.and all of those have to work, not one of them, and not one of them have -- be allowed to take off the table as if its not part of the overall solution to safety and security of our streets.tapper: the president is hitting the road tomorrow to start campaigning further for greater gun restrictions.', 'do you regret, when you were white house chief of staff, that the white house in the first term under president obama, did not do more on this issue?emanuel: well, look, you know, as chief of staff -- and you remember, jake, because you were there; you were covering it.you were covering the decision to make -- to take the auto industry that was on its knees, to close to collapse, and make sure that those jobs were created and made sure that the auto industry came back to the point it is today, that its adding more jobs than it was when the president was there.that was a crisis he inherited; it was one that took a lot of time and painstaking work to fix in the same way that the economy was headed -- going head over heels towards what is now known as the great recession.', 'and it took a lot on that aspect in the financial sector.', 'and to govern, as president kennedy said, is to make a set of choices.and the president made a set of choices to put in place the things that were necessary, given the financial, economic and auto manufacturing crises that he faced, not one of them, not two of them, all three of them simultaneously.and for people to then kind of look back and said, you know, in the middle of either the financial or the auto scandal, he should have done x, there are choices you make.', 'and he has properly given post- newtown and part other things that have happened in america making sure that washington now gets in place the gun control laws that are necessary to prevent criminals access to guns.but the notion that somehow in retrospect you should have pushed the auto industry crisis to the side, or the financial crisis to the side, you were there covering it; and you know that -- what the state of mind and where we were at that time.so this is where he is now in the second term and taking control of this situation, making sure that we have, for the first time since when i was in the white house under president clinton, i was a point person for passing both the brady bill and the assault weapon ban that we have the opportunity actually to make progress on getting sound, comprehensive gun control legislation that works with policing, prevention programs and encouraging strong

you no doubt -- and you know how close i am to the clintons and that she has a lot to offer if she decides to do that.', 'and theres no doubt, both on her record as former first lady, secretary of

have to say at the outset that cheating cannot be condoned, and this is a very sad day for atlanta.and, frankly, our union, our local back in 2005, when they saw the irregularities, whistle-blew the situation and was ignored.', 'so, the bottom line is we cant condone cheating.', 'and the vast number of teachers do an extraordinary job and do not succumb to cheating.but, at the same time, we have seen in city after city and state after state an environment and a climate that says that the tests are more important than anything else for kids, for teachers, and for schools, more important than teaching and learning, more important than critical thinking, more important than problem solving, more important than integrity.tapper: you say that, but most of the teachers and administrators in this system seem to have had no problem operating within the confines of the law.the nate scores, the state testing scores, have gone up, not just with these specific teachers and administrators, but across the state.', 'so why do you think this is related to teaching to the test, as opposed to just teachers trying to get ahead?', 'we know that the administrator got big bonuses based on these improvements.weingarten: well, you know, what -- if you talk to teachers about getting paid based upon test scores, they will universally recoil from it and get very insulted by it.', 'but at the same time, what weve seen is in 37 or 38 different places, weve seen this huge emphasis on testing and testing has narrowed the curriculum and has done -- and, worse, a lot of the tests that we have right now are not even correlated to what kids really need in a knowledge economy.but you are right.', 'most people did not succumb to cheating.', 'most people in atlanta did the right thing.', 'but what were seeing throughout the united states is that much more time is focused on testing as opposed to teaching and learning.lets take florida.', 'in florida, you have almost 80 days a year where some testing is going on in any particular school district.', 'in new york state, where i served on the cuomo commission, we saw from some superintendents in rochester, monroe county, they told us in the

government documents and interviews.federal agents used a confidential u.s. witness working inside the russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and

conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.advertisementrather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the department of justice (doj) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the american public and congress in the dark about russian nuclear corruption on u.s. soil during a period when the obama administration made two major decisions benefiting putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.the first decision occurred in october 2010, when the state department and government agencies on the committee on foreign investment in the united states unanimously approved the partial sale of canadian mining company uranium one to the russian nuclear giant rosatom, giving moscow control of more than 20 percent of america’s uranium supply.when this sale was used by trump on the campaign trail last year, hillary clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the state department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [committee on foreign investment in the united states] matter.”in 2011, the administration gave approval for rosatom’s tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to u.s. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the united states enrichment corp. before then, tenex had been limited to selling u.s. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s megatons to megawatts peace program.“the russians were compromising american contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns.', 'and none of that evidence got aired before the obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told the hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by u.s. or russian officials.the obama administration’s decision to approve rosatom’s purchase of uranium one has been a source of political controversy since 2015.that’s when conservative author peter schweitzer and the new york times documented how bill clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while hillary clinton presided on the committee on foreign investment in the united states.the obama administration and the clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the uranium one deal.but fbi, energy department and court documents reviewed by the hill show the fbi in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that vadim mikerin — the main russian overseeing putin’s nuclear expansion inside the united states — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.then-attorney general eric holder eric himpton holderholder redistricting group backs lawsuits for 3 additional majority-black congressional

they did not know whether the fbi or doj ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.spokesmen for holder and clinton did not return calls seeking comment.', 'the justice department also didn’t comment.mikerin was a director of rosatom’s tenex in moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the united states under the megatons to megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries.', 'in 2010, mikerin was dispatched to the u.s. on a work visa approved by the obama administration to open rosatom’s new american arm called tenam.between 2009 and january 2012, mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a november 2014 indictment stated.his illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an american businessman, who began making kickback payments at mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the fbi.', 'the first kickback payment recorded by the fbi through its informant was dated nov. 27, 2009, the records show.in evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an energy department agent assigned to assist the fbi in the case testified that mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in russia.“as part of the scheme, mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at tenex and rosatom (both russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to us businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” agent david gadren testified.“mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with tenex in russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.the investigation was ultimately supervised by then-u.s. attorney rod rosenstein, an obama appointee who now serves as president trump donald john trumpavenatti: i think that michael cohen is in

attorney general, and then-assistant fbi director andrew mccabe, now the deputy fbi director under trump, justice department documents show.both men now play a key role in the current investigation

by the fbi.', 'the probe is not focused on mcauliffes conduct but rather on whether mccabes attendance violated the hatch act or other fbi conflict rules.the connections to the current russia case are many.', 'the mikerin probe began in 2009 when robert mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the trump case, was still fbi director.', 'and it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-fbi director james comey, whom trump fired earlier this year.its many twist and turns aside, the fbi nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in cyprus, latvia and seychelles.', 'a russian financier in new jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.the case also exposed a serious national security breach: mikerin had given a contract to an american trucking firm called transport logistics international that held the sensitive job of transporting russia’s uranium around the united states in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.one of mikerin’s former employees told the fbi that tenex officials in russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.bringing down a major russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the u.s. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.but the justice department and fbi took little credit in 2014 when mikerin, the russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.the only public statement occurred a year later when the justice department put out a little-noticed press release in august 2015, just days before labor day.', 'the release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.by that time, the criminal cases against mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. and though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the committee on foreign investment in the united states’s approval.the final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the fbi undercover informant witnessed about the russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from russia’s nuclear industry to an american entity that had provided assistance to bill clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to the hill.the lack of fanfare left many key players in washington with no inkling that a major russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.on dec. 15, 2015, the justice department put out a release stating that mikerin, “a former russian official residing in maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.ronald hosko, who served as the assistant fbi director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told the hill he did not recall ever being briefed about mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.“i had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised hosko said in an interview.likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.former rep. mike rogers (r-mich.), who chaired the house intelligence committee during the time the fbi probe was being conducted, told the hill that he had never been told anything about the russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the obama administration’s approval of the uranium one deal.“not providing information on a corruption scheme before the russian uranium deal was approved by u.s. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine u.s. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” he said.', '“the russian efforts to manipulate our american political enterprise is breathtaking.”this story was updated at 6:50 p.m.indictment affidavit by m mali on scribdwarrant affidavit by

of slavery, segregation, lynching and ku klux klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.he adds: “the west will eventually turn against its muslim citizens.”the al-kataib media foundation released the video on twitter on friday, according to nbc.trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'but saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in biloxi, miss.', 'they began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that trump was providing grist for propagandists.some wondered whether the video was real.', 'more insisted that the al-qaeda affiliate was attacking trump out of fear.“isis, al-shabaad, al-qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want trump in office,” said richard coyne, 52, an army veteran from nearby gulfport, who retired last year.', '“they want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-isis, pro-al-qaeda, pro-muslim.” isis is another name for the extremist group islamic state.sarah anderson, 57, of hattiesburg, also an army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the berlin wall, said that any terrorist group that cited trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“he’s a threat to them,” she said.', '“that’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton had warned of trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists.', 'tom simmons, a 68-year-old vietnam war veteran from nearby vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“i can’t comprehend anything that the democrats say,” simmons said.', '“the terrorists fear trump right now.', 'they’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”in controversial remarks made after the san bernardino attack, trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[donald trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the united states]the propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to cnn.in the wake of the paris attacks, trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“i would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” trump said in an interview on “morning joe.”republican presidential candidate donald trump is saying democratic candidate hillary clinton lied about him at saturdays debate and is demanding an apology.', '(abc news/nbc news)the video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between trump and hillary clinton, in which clinton has claimed trump’s language aids jihadists.“if you go on arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of mr trump being translated to arabic,” clinton said at an iowa town hall last month.', '“ ‘no muslims coming to the united states,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”trump’s comments, clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make

new yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the senate for eight years.to be right across the water from the headquarters of the united nations, where i represented our country many times.to be here in this beautiful park dedicated to franklin roosevelt’s enduring vision of america, the nation we want to be.and in a place… with absolutely no ceilings.you know, president roosevelt’s four freedoms are a testament to our nation’s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad.', 'his legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed.', 'one is the man i served as secretary of state, barack obama, and another is my husband, bill clinton.two democrats guided by the — oh, that will make him so happy.', 'they were and are two democrats guided by the fundamental american belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.president roosevelt called on every american to do his or her part, and every american answered.', 'he said there’s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous america: “equality of opportunity… jobs for those who can work… security for those who need it… the ending of special privilege for the few… the preservation of civil liberties for all… a wider and constantly rising standard of living.”that still sounds good to me.it’s america’s basic bargain.', 'if you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead.', 'and when everybody does their part, america gets ahead too.that bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.it’s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.it’s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in chicago could provide us with a middle-class life.', 'and it did.when president clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.when president obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.but, it’s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. we face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.we’re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.instead of an economy built by every american, for every american, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.what happened?well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped.', 'you know where we ended up.except it wasn’t the end.as we have since our founding, americans made a new beginning.you worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs… you figured out how to make it work.', 'and now people are beginning to think about their future again – going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.so we’re standing again.', 'but, we all know we’re not yet running the way america should.you see corporations making record profits, with ceos making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.while many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of america’s kindergarten teachers combined.', 'and, often paying a lower tax rate.so, you have to wonder: “when does my hard work pay off?', 'when does my family get ahead?”“when?”i say now.prosperity can’t be just for ceos and hedge fund managers.democracy can’t be just for billionaires and corporations.prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.you brought our country back.now it’s time — your time to secure the gains and move ahead.and, you know what?america can’t succeed unless you succeed.that is why i am running for president of the united states.here, on roosevelt island, i believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny.', 'each american and the country we cherish.i’m running to make our economy work for you and for every american.for the successful and the struggling.for the innovators and inventors.for those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.for the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.for the nurses who work the night shift.for the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.for the veterans who served our country.for the small business owners who took a risk.for everyone who’s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.i’m not running for some americans, but for all americans.our country’s challenges didn’t begin with the great recession and they won’t end with the recovery.for decades, americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of americans.the financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value… too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done.', 'and they’ve lost trust in the ability of both government and big business to change course.now, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we’ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.our next president must work with congress and every other willing partner across our entire country.', 'and i will do just that — to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.at our best, that’s what americans do.', 'we’re problem solvers, not deniers.', 'we don’t hide from change, we harness it.but we can’t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.americans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.now, there may be some new voices in the presidential republican choir, but they’re all singing the same old song…a song called “yesterday.”you know the one — all our troubles look as though they’re here to stay… and we need a place to hide away… they believe in yesterday.and you’re lucky i didn’t try singing that, too, i’ll tell you!these republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.we’ve heard this tune before.', 'and we know how it turns out.ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they’ll say: “i’m not a scientist.” well, then, why don’t they start listening to those who are?they pledge to wipe out tough rules on wall street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures.', 'in a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.they want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million americans without offering any credible alternative.they shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.they want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.and they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy.', 'it takes an inclusive society.', 'what i once called “a village” that has a place for everyone.now, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for america.i believe that success isn’t measured by how much the wealthiest americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty…how many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive…how many young people go to college without drowning in debt…how many people find a good job…how many families get ahead and stay ahead.i didn’t learn this from politics.', 'i learned it from my own family.my mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion.', 'she knew what it was like not to have either one.her own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid.', 'years later, when i was old enough to understand, i asked what kept her going.you know what her answer was?', 'something very simple: kindness from someone who believed she mattered.the 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.the woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done.', 'that was a bargain she leapt to accept.and, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.that’s why i believe with all my heart in america and in the potential of every american.to meet every challenge.to be resilient… no matter what the world throws at you.to solve the toughest problems.i believe we can do all these things because i’ve seen it happen.as a young girl, i signed up at my methodist church to babysit the children of mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends.', 'and later, as a law student, i advocated for congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.my first job out of law school was for the children’s defense fund.', 'i walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn’t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.as a leader of the legal services corporation, i defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer.', 'and saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.in arkansas, i supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.as senator, i had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, emts, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.it took years of effort, but congress finally approved the health care they needed.there are so many faces and stories that i carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.just weeks ago, i met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.she doesn’t expect anything to come easy.', 'but she did ask me: what more can be done so it isn’t quite so hard for families like hers?i want to be her champion and your champion.if you’ll give me the chance, i’ll wage and win four fights for you.the first is to make the economy work for everyday americans, not just those at the top.to make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons.', 'and to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.the middle class needs more growth and more fairness.', 'growth and fairness go together.', 'for lasting prosperity, you can’t have one without the other.is this possible in today’s world?i believe it is or i wouldn’t be standing here.do i think it will be easy?', 'of course not.but, here’s the good news: there are allies for change everywhere who know we can’t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of america dims.', 'we should welcome the support of all americans who want to go forward together with us.there are public officials who know americans need a better deal.business leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the lgbt community either.there are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.there are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow’s economy.', 'we need everyone to come to the table and work with us.in the coming weeks, i’ll propose specific policies to:reward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck – because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.i will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.i will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.we will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.we will restore america to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.and we will make america the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.developing renewable power – wind, solar, advanced biofuels…building cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings…using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment…and ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to indian country, from small towns in the mississippi delta to the rio grande valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow americans.now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable america to lead the global fight against climate change.we will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses.', 'customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.we will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.now, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.that’s why i will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in america.and i want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this.', 'research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success.', 'in fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.one thing i’ve learned is that talent is universal – you can find it anywhere – but opportunity is not.', 'too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.our country won’t be competitive or fair if we don’t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.so let’s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.let’s make college affordable and available to all …and lift the crushing burden of student debt.let’s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more americans for success.now, the second fight is to strengthen america’s families, because when our families are strong, america is strong.and today’s families face new and unique pressures.', 'parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.i believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.i believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.i believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.that you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.i believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.and it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job — and women of color often making even less.this isn’t a women’s issue.', 'it’s a family issue.', 'just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue.', 'expanding childcare is a family issue.', 'declining marriage rates is a family issue.', 'the unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue.', 'helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.in america, every family should feel like they belong.so we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship.', 'not second-class status.and, we should ban discrimination against lgbt americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.you know, america’s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what’s drawn so many to our shores.', 'what’s inspired people all over the world.', 'i know.', 'i’ve seen it with my own eyes.and these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.so we have a third fight: to harness all of america’s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.no other country on earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century.', 'no other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like russia, north korea, and iran – and to deal with the rise of new powers like china.no other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like isis, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.as your president, i’ll do whatever it takes to keep americans safe.and if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new world trade center soaring skyward.as a senator from new york, i dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover.', 'and as a member of the armed services committee, i worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today’s threats and tomorrow’s.and when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, i’ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they’ve earned.i’ve stood up to adversaries like putin and reinforced allies like israel.', 'i was in the situation room on the day we got bin laden.but, i know — i know we have to be smart as well as strong.meeting today’s global challenges requires every element of america’s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.there are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there’s a lot of good news out there too.i believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.and we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home.', 'that’s why we have to win the fourth fight – reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday americans.we have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.we need justices on the supreme court who will protect every citizen’s right to vote, rather than every corporation’s right to buy elections.if necessary, i will support a constitutional amendment to undo the supreme court’s decision in citizens united.i want to make it easier for every citizen to vote.', 'that’s why i’ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.i’ll fight back against republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.what part of democracy are they afraid of?no matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give americans something worth voting for.government is never going to have all the answers – but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.that means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the american people.we need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.there’s so much that works in america.', 'for every problem we face, someone somewhere in america is solving it.', 'silicon valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago.', 'many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services.', 'i want to help washington catch up.to do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.now, i’ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike.', 'but i’ll also stand my ground when i must.that’s something i did as senator and secretary of state — whether it was working with republicans to expand health care for children and for our national guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities — and it’s something i will always do as your president.we americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other’s back.like any family, our american family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.people all over the world have asked me: “how could you and president obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?”now, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled – even killed – not hired as secretary of state.but president obama asked me to serve, and i accepted because we both love our country.', 'that’s how we do it in america.with that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.we can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.we can strengthen our families.we can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.and we can renew the promise of our democracy.if we all do our part.', 'in our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.i want you to join me in this effort.', 'help me build this campaign and make it your own.talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.text “join” j-o-i-n to 4-7-2-4-6.go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.it’s no secret that we’re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for america.', 'but i’ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country.', 'and i’m not stopping now.you know, i know how hard this job is.', 'i’ve seen it up close and personal.all our presidents come into office looking so vigorous.', 'and then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.well, i may not be the youngest candidate in this race.', 'but i will be the youngest woman president in the history of the united states!and the first grandmother as well.and one additional advantage: you’re won’t see my hair turn white in the white house.', 'i’ve been coloring it for years!so i’m looking forward to a great debate among democrats, republicans, and independents.', 'i’m not running to be a president only for those americans who already agree with me.', 'i want to be a president for all americans.and along the way, i’ll just let you in on this little secret.', 'i won’t get everything right.', 'lord knows i’ve made my share of mistakes.', 'well, there’s no shortage of people pointing them out!and i certainly haven’t won every battle i’ve fought.', 'but leadership means perseverance and hard choices.', 'you have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.i think you know by now that i’ve been called many things by many people — “quitter” is not one of them.like so much else in my life, i got this from my mother.when i was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier.', 'in her later years, mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons.', 'i’d come home from a hard day at the senate or the state department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out.', 'and she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.i can still hear her saying: “life’s not about what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you – so get back out there.”she lived to be 92 years old, and i often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century — all the progress that was won because americans refused to give up or back down.she was born on june 4, 1919 — before women in america had the right to vote.', 'but on that very day, after years of struggle, congress passed the constitutional amendment that would change that forever.the story of america is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress.', 'and it continues today.', 'new chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us – not just some, but all – should have the chance to live up to our god-given potential.not only because we’re a tolerant country, or a generous

have been with us longer.', 'i wish she could have seen chelsea become a mother herself.', 'i wish she could have met charlotte.i wish she could have seen the america we’re going to build together.an

malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of florida governor rick scott.', 'the source exclusively revealed to big league politics that sheriff israel is also allegedly being investigated by the irs.the high-level police source within the sheriff’s office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of broward county sheriff.', 'one of the candidates who were interviewed is emery giany, a republican florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with florida attorney general pam bondi.during the ig’s testimony last week, fbi director christopher wray was asked about the parkland school shooting.', 'when asked, wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and sheriff israel, citing that it was an active fbi investigation.', 'following the parkland shooting, governor scott called for director wray to resign over the fbi’s failure to properly investigate nikolas cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the fbi twice prior to the shooting on valentine’s day.“we constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a

office and fbi failed to properly investigate cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in parkland, fl.since the parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding sheriff israel.', 'along with being a mouthpiece for democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz who he has been photographed with, sheriff israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.in may, it was revealed that marjory stoneman douglas high school and the broward county sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that sheriff israel’s son, brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.shortly after the parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on february 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.most recently, sheriff israel received a massive amount of backlash after the broward county sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made broward sheriff’s car that read, “our new #dodge #charger.', 'do you like the paint job?”the tweet sparked outrage online from republicans and democrats alike who quipped that the broward sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars.', 'leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for sheriff israel to resign or be removed by the governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in us history.during the florida gop primary debate in florida last week, florida agriculture commissioner adam putnam and rep. ron desantis were asked about the parkland school

to be one of the most important senate races in the country.in the days following the parkland shooting, sheriff scott israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the democratic party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the fbi accountable.', 'unable to withstand tough questioning, sheriff israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer.', 'he is solely responsible for this horrific act.” however, as the investigation into

an advantage to her plan.the reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate.', 'that is not a mandate for the government to provide coverage to everybody; it is a mandate that every individual purchase health care.and the mailing that we put out accurately indicates that the main difference between senator clintons plan and mine is the fact

there is a hardship exemption as theyve done in massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out.', 'and if thats the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate.now, senator clinton has not indicated how she would enforce this mandate.', 'she hasnt indicated what level of subsidy she would provide to assure that it was, in fact, affordable.', 'and so it is entirely legitimate for us to point out these differences.but i think its very important to understand the context of this, and that is that senator clinton has -- her campaign, at least -- has constantly sent out negative attacks on us, e-mail, robocalls, flyers, television ads, radio calls.and, you know, we havent whined about it because i understand thats the nature of these campaigns,

senator clinton, on this subject --sen. clinton: but i have to -- i have to respond to that because this is not just any issue, and certainly weve had a vigorous back and forth on both sides of our

person.senator obama has a mandate in his plan.', 'its a mandate on parents to provide health insurance for their children.', 'thats about 150 million people who would be required to do that.', 'the difference between senator obama and myself is that i know, from the work ive done on health care for many years, that if everyones not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do whats called cherry picking -- pick those who get insurance and leave others out.we will continue to have a hidden tax, so that when someone goes to the emergency room without insurance -- 15 million or however many -- that amount of money that will be used to take care of that person will be then spread among all the rest of us.and most importantly, you know, the kind of attack on my health care

democratic party value.', 'its something that ever since harry truman we have stood for.advertisement continue reading the main storyand what i find regrettable is that in senator obamas mailing that he has sent out across ohio, it is almost as though the health insurance companies and the republicans wrote it, because in my plan there is enough money, according to the independent experts whove evaluated it, to provide the kind of subsidies so that everyone would be able to afford it.', 'it is not the same as a single state trying to do this, because the federal government has many more resources at its disposal.sen.', 'obama (?', '): (inaudible.)sen.', 'clinton: so i think its imperative that we stand as democrats for universal health care.', 'ive staked out a claim for that.',

clinton.', 'and this is -- this is, i think, the point of the debate, is that senator clinton repeatedly claims that i dont stand for universal health care.', 'and, you know, for senator clinton to say that, i think, is simply not accurate.every expert has said that anybody who wants health care under my plan will be able to obtain it.', 'president clintons own secretary of labor has said that my plan does more to reduce costs and as a consequence makes sure that the people who need health care right now all across ohio, all across texas, rhode island, vermont, all across america, will be able to obtain it.', 'and we do more to reduce costs than any other plan thats been out there.now, i have no objection to senator clinton thinking that her approach is superior, but the fact of the matter is, is that if, as weve heard tonight, we still dont know how senator clinton intends to enforce a mandate, and if we dont know the level of subsidies that shes going to provide, then you can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still cant afford it, even with the subsidies.and they are then worse off.', 'they then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that.mr.', 'williams: thank you.sen.', 'obama: that is a genuine difference between myself and senator clinton.and the last point i would make is, the insurance companies actually are happy to have a mandate.', 'the insurance companies dont mind making sure that

case.if you have a mandate, it has to be enforceable.', 'so theres no difference here.sen.', 'obama: no, there is a difference.sen.', 'clinton: its just that i know that parents who get sick have terrible consequences for their children.', 'so you can insure the children, and then youve got the bread-winner who cant afford health insurance or doesnt have it for him or herself.and in fact, it would be as though franklin roosevelt said lets make social security voluntary -- thats -- you know, thats -- lets let everybody get in it if they can afford it -- or if president johnson said lets make medicare voluntary.sen.', 'obama: well, let me --sen. clinton: what we have said is that at the point of employment, at the point of contact with various government agencies, we would have people signed up.', 'its like when you get a 401(k), its your employer.', 'the employer automatically enrolls you.', 'you would be enrolled.and under my plan, it is affordable because, number one, we have enough money in our plan.', 'a comparison of the plans like the ones were proposing found that actually i would cover nearly everybody at a much lower cost than senator obamas plan because we would not only provide these health care tax credits, but i would limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for a premium to a low percentage of your income.', 'so it will be affordable.now, if you want to say that we shouldnt try to get everyone into health insurance, thats a big difference, because i believe if we dont have universal health care, we will never provide

are many experts who have concluded that she does not.i do provide a mandate for children, because, number one, we have created a number of programs in which we can have greater assurance that those children will be covered at an affordable price.', 'on the -- on the point of many adults, we dont want to put in a situation in which, on the front end, we are mandating them, we are forcing them to purchase insurance, and if the subsidies are inadequate, the burden is on them, and they will be penalized.', 'and that is what senator clintons plan does.now, i am -- i am happy to have a discussion with senator clinton about how we can both achieve the goal of universal health care.', 'what i do not accept -- and which is what senator clinton has consistently done and in fact the same experts she cites basically say theres no real difference between our plans, that are -- that they are not substantial.but it has to do with how we are going to achieve universal health care.', 'that is an area where i believe that if we make it affordable, people will purchase it.', 'in fact, medicare part b is not mandated, it is voluntary.', 'and yet people over 65 choose to purchase it, hillary, and

have to say, tim, with respect to my position on this, when i ran for the united states senate, the chicago tribune, which was adamantly pro-nafta, noted that, in their endorsement of me, they were endorsing me despite my strong opposition to nafta.and that conversation that i had with the farm bureau, i was not ambivalent at all.', 'what i said was that nafta and other trade deals can be beneficial to the united states because i believe every u.s. worker is as productive as any worker around the world, and we can compete with anybody.', 'and we cant shy away from globalization.', 'we cant draw a moat around us.', 'but what i did say, in that same quote, if you look at it, was that the problem is weve been negotiating just looking at corporate profits and whats good for

to prosper as we move forward.mr.', 'russert: senator, two journalists here in ohio wrote a piece called business as usual, which is very well known, suggesting it wasnt trade or manufacturing jobs that were being lost because of it, but rather business as usual: lack of patents, lack of innovation, lack of investment, 70 percent of the ph.d.s in biology, chemistry, engineering leaving the state.the fact is, exports now have the highest share of our national income ever.', 'ohio ranks fourth in terms of exports to canada and mexico.', 'are you sure this has not been better for ohio than youre suggesting?sen.', 'obama: im positive it hasnt been better for ohio.', 'but you are making a very legitimate point, which is, is that this trade (can/cant ?)', 'be the only part of our economic agenda.', 'but weve seen seven years in which we have a president who has been looking out for the well-heeled and people who are doing very well in the global economy, in the financial industries, in the telecommunications industries, and has not been looking out for ordinary workers.what do we have to do?', 'were going to have to invest in infrastructure to make sure that were competitive.', 'and ive got a plan to do that.', 'were going to have to invest in science and technology.', 'weve got to vastly improve our education system.', 'we have to look at energy and the potential for creating green jobs that can not just save on our energy costs but, more importantly, can create jobs in building windmills that will produce manufacturing jobs here in ohio, can put rural communities back on their feet by working on alternative fuels, making buildings more energy efficient.we can hire young people who are out of work and put them to work in the trade.', 'so there are all sorts of things

states of america.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, on the issue of jobs, i watched you the other day with your economic blueprint in wisconsin saying, this is my plan; hold me accountable.', 'and ive had a chance to read it very carefully.', 'it does say that you pledge to create 5 million new jobs over 10 years.and i was reminded of your campaign in 2000 in buffalo, my hometown, just three hours down route 90, where you pledged 200,000 new jobs for upstate new york.', 'theres been a net loss of 30,000 jobs.', 'and when you were asked about your pledge, your commitment, you told the buffalo

values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity.and as you know, despite the difficulties of the bush administration and a republican congress for six years of my first term i have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president i will have a lot more tools at my disposal.', 'and the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- i mean, this is not a big leap.', 'twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the clinton administration under my husband.', 'we can create at least 5 million new jobs.im not just talking about it.', 'i helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs.', 'i want to see people throughout ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and i know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the democrats wanted, as i originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those.you know, take a country like germany.', 'they made a big bet on solar power.', 'they have a smaller economy and population than ours.theyve created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that cant be outsourced.', 'these are jobs that have to be done in youngstown, in dayton, in cincinnati.', 'these are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through.', 'so i do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years.mr.', 'russert: brian?mr.', 'williams: senator obama, yesterday senator clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and im going to read you a quote from it.', 'quote, weve seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security.', 'we cannot let that happen again.', 'america has already taken that chance one time too many.', 'some of the comments in the speech were more pointed.', 'the senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of george w. bush at the same period.', 'provided you could be going into a general election against a republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair?sen.', 'obama: well, senator clinton i think equates experience with longevity in washington.', 'i dont think the american people do and i dont think that if you look at the judgments that weve made over the last several years that thats the accurate measure.', 'on the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into iraq -- i was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-american sentiment -- that it would distract us from afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and i do not believe it has made us more safe.al qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that john mccain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both senator clinton and i are talking about.', 'so on pakistan, during the summer i suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern pakistan.advertisement continue reading the main storyand many people said at the time well, you cant target those terrorists because musharraf is our ally and we dont want to offend him.', 'in fact, what we had was neither stability in pakistan nor democracy in pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in pakistan we would be much further along now than we are.', 'so on the critical issues that actually matter i believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that i think has been superior to senator clintons as well as senator mccains.mr.', 'williams: well, senator clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not senator obama was qualified to be commander in chief.', 'is your contention in this latest speech that america would somehow be taking a chance on senator obama as commander in chief?sen.', 'clinton: well, i have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in northern ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to beijing and standing up for womens rights as human rights and so much else.', 'and every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, senator obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. hes to be commended for having given the speech.', 'many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didnt have responsibility, he didnt have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way george bush was conducting the war.', 'and when he came to the senate, he and i have voted exactly the same.', 'we have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently.', 'so the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasnt just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference?', 'where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war?and on a number of other issues, i just believe that, you know, as senator obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan, which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take.', 'i have long advocated a much tougher approach to musharraf and to pakistan, and have pushed the white house to do that.and i disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it.so i think youve got to look at, you know, what i have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the senate armed services committee for now five years.', 'and i think that, you know, standing on that stage with senator mccain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, i will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really america must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country.mr.', 'williams: senator obama, a quick response.sen.', 'obama: let me just follow up.', 'my objections to the war in iraq were simply -- not simply a speech.', 'i was in the midst of a u.s. senate campaign.', 'it was a high-stakes campaign.', 'i was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and i was very specific as to why.and so when i bring this up, it is not simply to say i told you so, but it is to give you an insight in terms of how i would make decisions.advertisement continue reading the main storyand the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder.', 'it was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then weve voted the same way.', 'once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out.', 'the question is, whos making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch?', 'and the fact is that senator clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to george bush on day one on this critical issue.', 'so the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we cant afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the united states of america.with respect to pakistan, i never said i would bomb pakistan.', 'what i said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin laden or other key al qaeda officials, and we -- and pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should.', 'and just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al qaeda official.that is the position that we should have taken in the first place.', 'and president musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we dont know how the new legislature in pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy.and so my claim is not simply based on a speech.', 'it is based on the judgments that ive displayed during the course of my service on the senate foreign relations committee, while ive been in the united states senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, i think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against bush and cheney.', 'and that is how were going to be able to debate john mccain.', 'having a debate with john mccain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, i think, does not put you in a strong position.tim

'you both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from iraq.', 'you both have said youd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al qaeda, to neutralize iran.', 'if the iraqi government said, president clinton or president obama, youre pulling out your troops this quickly?youre going to be gone in a year, but youre going to leave a residual force behind?', 'no.', 'get out.', 'get out now.', 'if you dont want to stay and protect us, were a sovereign nation.', 'go home now.', 'will you leave?sen.', 'obama: well, if the iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there.', 'this is a sovereign government, as george bush continually reminds us.now, i think that we can be in a partnership with iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of iraqis and to meet our national security interests.but in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why i have said that as soon as i take office, i will call in the joint chiefs of staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in.', 'we will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed.', 'we will provide them continued support.', 'but it is important for us not to be held hostage by the iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, thats distracting us from afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in america that will make us more competitive and more safe.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, if the iraqis said im sorry, were not happy with this arrangement; if youre not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'and i believe that there is no military solution that the americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the iraqi government.', 'and --mr. russert: let me ask -- let me ask you this, senator.', 'i want to ask you --sen. clinton: and they need to take responsibility for themselves.', 'and --mr. russert: i want to ask both of you this question, then.', 'if we -- if this scenario plays out and the americans get out in total and al qaeda resurges and iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as american president, to re-invade, to go back into iraq to stabilize it?sen.', 'clinton: you know, tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals.', 'and i believe that whats --mr. russert: but this is reality.sen.', 'clinton: no -- well, it isnt reality.', 'youre -- youre -- youre making lots of different hypothetical assessments.i believe that it is in americas interests and in the interests of the iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal.', 'ive been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and ive been pushing them to actually do it.', 'ive also said that i would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that i asked begun to be put together as soon as i became president.and i think we can take out one to two brigades a month.', 'ive also been a leader in trying to prevent president bush from getting us committed to staying in iraq regardless for as long as senator mccain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years.so, when you talk about what we need to do in iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of america.', 'and i believe this is in the best interest.but i also have heard senator obama refer continually to afghanistan, and he references being on the foreign relations committee.', 'he chairs the subcommittee on europe.', 'it has jurisdiction over nato.', 'nato is critical to our mission in afghanistan.', 'hes held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato in afghanistan.you have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, i want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee.', 'but also, do you reserve a right as american president to go back into iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war?sen.', 'obama: well, first of all, i became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. so it

allies to put more troops into afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in iraq and i think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in afghanistan in part because of whats happened in iraq.now, i always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, i will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for american interests.', 'and if al qaeda is forming a base in iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the american homeland and our interests abroad.', 'so that is true, i think, not just in iraq, but thats true in other places.', 'thats part of my argument with respect to pakistan.i think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in

-- (laughter, applause) -- of all the charges and countercharges made tonight, we can confirm that is not you, senator obama.sen.', 'obama: (chuckles.)mr.', 'williams: that was senator clinton.', 'but since we played that tape, albeit in error, for this segment, how did you take that?sen.', 'clinton: (laughs.)(laughter.)mr.', 'williams: how did you take those remarks when you heard them?sen.', 'obama: well, i thought senator clinton showed some good humor there.', 'i would give her points for delivery.sen.', 'clinton: (laughs.)(laughter.)sen.', 'obama: look, i understand the broader point that senator clintons been trying to make over the last several weeks.', 'you know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action.', 'and as i said in the last debate, ive spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and theyre seeking out the american dream.', 'thats how i started my career in public service, thats how i brought democrats and republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, thats how i helped to reform a welfare system that wasnt working in illinois, thats how ive provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so im very proud of that track record.and if senator clinton thinks that its all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at walter reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before i got to the senate.', 'and i changed that law.', 'or talk to those folks who i think have recognized that special interests are dominating washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in ohio.and so when i pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists cant get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of congress and they have to disclose who theyre getting money from and who theyre bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families.just one point ill make, i was in cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one.', 'and these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they dont have health care.', 'one of them doesnt have a job.', 'one of them is looking after an aging parent.', 'two of them were looking after disabled children.', 'one of them was dipping into their retirement accounts because she had been put on disability on the job.', 'and you hear these stories and what you realize is nobody has been listening to them.', 'that is not who george bush or dick cheney has been advocating for over the last seven years.and so i am not interested in talk.', 'i am not interested in speeches.', 'i would not be running if i wasnt absolutely convinced that i can put an economic agenda forward that is going to provide them with health care, is going to make college more affordable, and is going to get them the kinds of help that they need not to solve all their problems, but at least to be able to achieve the american dream.mr.', 'williams: well, let me ask you, senator clinton: what did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, i was having a little fun.', 'you know, its hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in.but the larger point is that i know trying to get health insurance for every american thats affordable will not be easy.', 'its not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody its the right thing to do.', 'you know, 15 years ago i tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and i know it takes a fighter.', 'it takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests.you know, i have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies.', 'these have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the white house did, but because members of congress went along.', 'and i want to get that money back and invest it in the american middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout ohio, because what i hear as i go from toledo to parma to cleveland to, you know, dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but theyre not getting ahead.', 'they feel like theyre invisible to their government.', 'so when it came time to vote on dick cheneys energy bill, i voted no, and senator obama voted yes.', 'when it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which i think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- i voted yes and senator obama voted no.mr.', 'williams: and senator -- senator --sen. clinton: so part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight.', 'and i believe that i am a fighter, and i will fight for the people of ohio and the people of america.mr.', 'williams: what i was attempting to do here is to show something senator obama said about you, and im told its ready.mr.', 'russert: lets try it.mr.', 'williams: lets try it.', 'hang on.', 'watch your monitor.lets try it.', 'were going to come back to you.sen.', 'obama: but im going to have an opportunity to respond to this.sen.', 'obama: (from videotape.)', '-- herself as co-president during the clinton years.', 'every good thing that happened she says she was a part of.', 'and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.mr.', 'williams: now, senator obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but ive been wanting to ask you about this assertion that senator clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president.sen.', 'obama: well, i think what is absolutely true is, is that when senator clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, heres what i did.heres what we did.', 'heres what we accomplished -- which is fine.and i have not -- i have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and i dont begrudge her claiming that as experience.', 'what ive said, and what i would continue to maintain, is you cant take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like nafta, you say, well, i -- behind the scenes, i was disagreeing.', 'that doesnt work.', 'so you have to, i think, take both responsibility as well as credit.now there are several points that i think senator clinton made that i -- we need to discuss here.', 'first of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards.', 'keep in mind, i objected to the entire bill -- a bill that senator clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for.', 'and in one of the debates with you guys said, well, i voted for it, but i hoped it wouldnt pass -- which, as a general rule, doesnt work.', 'if you dont want it to pass, you vote against it.', '(laughter.', ')you know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care.', 'and look -- i do not in any way doubt that senator clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all americans.what i have said is that the way she approached it back in 93, i think, was wrong in part because she had the view that whats required is simply to fight.', 'and senator clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party.', 'and as a consequence, there were a number of people, like jim cooper of tennessee and bill bradley and pat moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations.', 'and we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done.i am absolutely clear that hope is not enough.', 'and it is not going to be easy to pass health care.', 'if it was, it would have already gotten done.', 'its not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country.', 'exxonmobil made $11 billion last quarter.', 'they are not going to give up those profits easily.but what i also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, were going to have to mobilize and inspire the american people so that theyre paying attention to what their government is doing.', 'and thats what ive been doing in this campaign, and thats what i will do as president.and theres nothing romantic or silly about that.', 'if the american people are activated, thats how change is going to happen.the second thing weve going to have to do is were actually going to have to go after the special interests.senator clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you cant just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away.', 'that is absolutely true, but it doesnt help if youre taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests.', 'they are less likely to go away.so it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence congress.', 'and yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the american people to get involved and pay attention.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word.', 'nothing more important.', 'last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out.', 'you checked yes on a questionnaire.', 'and now senator mccain has said, calling your bluff, lets do it.', 'you seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here.why wont you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election?sen.', 'obama: tim, i am not yet the nominee.', 'now, what ive said is, is that when i am the nominee, if i am the nominee -- because weve still got a bunch of contests left and senator clintons a pretty tough opponent.', 'if i am the nominee, then i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes.senator mccain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people arent exactly clear whether all the ts were crossed and the is were dotted.now what i want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign.', 'i said very early on i would not take pac money.', 'i would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists.', 'that -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because i had confidence that the american people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign.we have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50.', 'we average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the american people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody whos interested in good government and politics supports.mr.', 'russert: so you may opt out of public financing.', 'you may break your word.sen.', 'obama: what i -- what i have said is, at the point where im the nominee, at the point where its appropriate, i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.mr.', 'russert: senator clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility.', 'you have loaned your campaign $5 million.', 'you and your husband file a joint return.', 'you refuse to release that joint return, even though former president clinton has had significant overseas business dealings.your chief supporter here in ohio, governor strickland, made releasing his opponents tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, accountability, transparency.', 'if hes not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding?', 'we should question whats going on.why wont you release your tax return, so the voters of ohio, texas, vermont, rhode island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign?sen.', 'clinton: well, the american people who support me are bankrolling my campaign.', 'thats -- thats obvious.', 'you can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that ive gotten.', 'and ever since i lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously.', 'im thrilled at so many people getting involved.', 'and were raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the internet.', 'and if anybodys out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to hillaryclinton.com, because thats whos funding my campaign.and i will release my tax returns.', 'i have consistently said that.', 'and i will --mr. russert: why not now?sen.', 'clinton: well, i will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, tim, because i have been as open as i can be.you have -- the public has 20 years of records for me, and i have very extensive filings with the senate where --mr. russert: so, before next tuesdays primary?sen.', 'clinton: well, i cant get it together by then, but i will certainly work to get it together.', 'im a little busy right now; i hardly have time to sleep.', 'but i will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain.mr.', 'russert: one other issue.', 'you talked about releasing documents.', 'on january 30th, the national archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady.', 'its now in the custody of former president clinton.', 'will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years?sen.', 'clinton: absolutely.', 'ive urged that the process be as quick as possible.', 'its a cumbersome process, set up by law.', 'it doesnt just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position.', 'and i have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can.', 'now, also, president bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and i would urge the bush white house to move as quickly as possible.mr.', 'russert: but youve had it for more than a month.', 'will you get to him -- will you get it to the white house immediately?sen.', 'clinton: as soon as we can, tim.', 'ive urged that, and i hope it will happen.mr.', 'russert: senator obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments.on sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, chicago tribune: louis farrakhan backs obama for president at nation of islam convention in chicago.', 'do you accept the support of louis farrakhan?sen.', 'obama: you know, i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti-semitic comments.', 'i think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible.', 'i did not solicit this support.', 'he expressed pride in an african-american who seems to be bringing the country together.', 'i obviously cant censor him, but it is not support that i sought.', 'and were not doing anything, i assure you, formally or informally with minister farrakhan.mr.', 'russert: do you reject his support?sen.', 'obama: well, tim, you know, i cant say to somebody that he cant say that he thinks im a good guy.', '(laughter.)', 'you know, i -- you know, i -- i have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and i think that indicates to the american people what my stance is on those comments.mr.', 'russert: the problem some voters may have is, as you know, reverend farrakhan called judaism gutter religion.obama: tim, i think -- i am very familiar with his record, as are the american people.', 'thats why i have consistently denounced it.this is not something new.', 'this is something that -- i live in chicago.', 'he lives in chicago.', 'ive been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate.', 'and i have consistently distanced myself from him.russert: the title of one of your books, audacity of hope, you acknowledge you got from a sermon from reverend jeremiah wright, the head of the trinity united church.', 'he said that louis farrakhan epitomizes greatness.he said that he went to libya in 1984 with louis farrakhan to visit with moammar gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, your jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in hell.russert: what do you do to assure jewish-americans that, whether its farrakhans support or the activities of reverend jeremiah wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding israel and not in any way suggesting that farrakhan epitomizes greatness?obama: tim, i have some of the strongest support from the jewish community in my hometown of chicago and in this presidential campaign.', 'and the reason is because i have been a stalwart friend of israels.', 'i think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and i think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the united states is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the jewish community.and the reason that i have such strong support is because they know that not only would i not tolerate anti-semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what i want to do is rebuild what i consider to be a historic relationship between the african-american community and the jewish community.you know, i would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of jewish americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the south.', 'and that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened.but, you know, the reason that i have such strong support in the jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my u.s. senate campaign and its true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that i consistently have not only befriended the jewish community, not only have i been strong on israel, but, more importantly, ive been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable.when i was -- just last point i would make -- when i was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at ebenezer baptist church in conjunction with martin luther kings birthday in front of a large african-american audience, i specifically spoke out against anti- semitism within the african-american community.', 'and thats what gives people confidence that i will continue to do that when im president of the united states.williams: senator...clinton: i just want to add something here, because i faced a similar situation when i ran for the senate in 2000 in new york.', 'and in new york, there are more than the two parties, democratic and republican.', 'and one of the parties at that time, the independence party, was under the control of people who were anti-semitic, anti- israel.', 'and i made it very clear that i did not want their support.', 'i rejected it.', 'i said that it would not be anything i would be comfortable with.', 'and it looked as though i might pay a price for that.', 'but i would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either israel or jewish people in our country.and, you know, i was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of new york supported me and i won.', 'but at the time, i thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that.russert: are you suggesting senator obama is not standing on principle?clinton: no.', 'im just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it.', 'and theres a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'and i think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- i have no doubt that everything that barack just said is absolutely sincere.', 'but i just think, weve got to be even stronger.', 'we cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching.obama: tim, i have to say i dont see a difference between denouncing and rejecting.', 'theres no formal offer of help from minister farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it.', 'but if the word reject senator clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce, then im happy to concede the point, and i would reject and denounce.clinton: good.', 'good.', 'excellent.', '(applause)williams: rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing.were going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks.', 'well be back live from cleveland right after this.', '(commercial break)williams: we are back from cleveland state university.', 'we continue with our debate.the question beginning this segment is for you, senator obama.the national journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of ted kennedy.in a general election, going up against a republican party, looking for converts, republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than ted kennedy?obama: well, first of all, lets take a look at what the national journal rated us on.it turned out that senator clinton and i had differences on two votes.', 'the first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldnt go back, and i thought it was bad policy.the second -- and this, i think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- i supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the senate, because i thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the senate, that they werent being investigated by the senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it.this is something that ive tried to push as part of my ethics package.obama: it was rejected.', 'and according to the national journal, that position is a liberal position.now, i dont think thats a liberal position.', 'i think there are a lot of republicans and a lot of independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated.', 'so the categories dont make sense.and part of the reason i think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that senator obamas campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more independent votes than any other candidate in the democratic primary, and republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head?', 'its because people dont want to go back to those old categories of whats liberal and whats conservative.they want to see who is making sense, whos fighting for them, whos going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense?', 'thats what ive been doing, and thats why, you know, the proof is in the pudding.', 'weve been attracting more independent and republican support than anybody else, and thats why every poll shows that right now i beat john mccain in a match-up in the general election.williams: lets go from domestic to foreign affairs and tim russert.russert: before the primary on tuesday, on sunday, march 2, theres an election in russia for the successor to president putin.', 'what can you tell me about the man whos going to be mr. putins successor?clinton: well, i can tell you that hes a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by putin, who putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know.', 'you know, theres a lot of information still to be acquired.', 'that the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against putins hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising putin.', 'so this is a clever but transparent way for putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how were going to deal with russia going forward.i have been very critical of the bush administration for what i believe to have been an incoherent policy toward russia.', 'and with the reassertion of russias role in europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting irans nuclear ambitions, for example, its imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward russia.', 'but i have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by putin.russert: who will it be?', 'do you know his name?clinton: medvedev -- whatever.russert: yes.clinton: yes.russert: senator obama, do you know anything about him?obama: well, i think senator clinton speaks accurately about him.', 'he is somebody who was hand-picked by putin.', 'putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in russia in terms of running the government.', 'and, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of president bushs administration when he said -- you know, he met with putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him.he then proceeded to neglect our relationship with russia at a time when putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his european neighbors, as well as satellites of the former soviet union.', 'and so we did not send a signal to mr. putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us.', 'that is something that we have to change.russert: hes 42 years old, hes a former law professor.', 'he is mr. putins campaign manager.', 'he is going to be the new president of russia.', 'and if he says to the russian troops, you know what, why dont you go help serbia retake kosovo, what does president obama do?obama: well, i think that we work with the international community that has also recognized kosovo, and state that thats unacceptable.', 'but, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in nato to deal with this issue.we dont have to work in isolation.', 'and this is an area where i think that the clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned.obama: it has not been perfect, but it saved lives.', 'and we created a situation in which not only kosovo, but other parts of the former yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader european community.but, you know, be very clear: we have recognized the country of kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has great britain and many other countries in the region.', 'and i think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded.russert: before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service.', 'looking back through them, is there any words or vote that youd like to take back?senator clinton?clinton: well, obviously, ive said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding iraq was a sincere vote, i would not have voted that way again.i would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in iraq.', 'and i regret deeply that president bush waged a preemptive war, which i warned against and said i disagreed with.but i think that this election has to be about the future.', 'it has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what were going to inherit.you know, weve just been talking about russia.', 'we could have gone around the world.', 'we could have gone to latin america and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy.', 'we could have talked about africa and the failure to end the genocide in darfur.we could have gone on to talk about the challenge that china faces and the middle east, which is deteriorating under the pressures of hamas, hezbollah, and the interference that is putting israels security at stake.we could have done an entire program, tim, on what we will inherit from george bush.and what i believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of pennsylvania avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we dont have much time to try to make up for our losses.russert: but to be clear, youd like to have your vote back?clinton: absolutely.', 'ive said that many times.russert: senator obama, any statements or vote youd like to take back?obama: well, you know, when i first arrived in the senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding terri schiavo.', 'and i remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families.it wasnt something i was comfortable with, but it was not something that i stood on the floor and stopped.', 'and i think that was a mistake, and i think the american people understood that that was a mistake.', 'and as a constitutional law professor, i knew better.and so thats an example i think of where inaction...russert: this is the young woman with the feeding tube...obama: thats exactly right.russert: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not.obama: and i think thats an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action.but let me say this, since were wrapping up this debate.', 'we have gone through 20 debates now.', 'and, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and weve got four coming up, and maybe more after that.but the one thing im absolutely clear about is senator clinton has campaigned magnificently.', 'she is an outstanding public servant.', 'and im very proud to have been campaigning with her.and part of what i think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the american people.you know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics.', 'but when you spend as much time as senator clinton and i have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that peoples expectations are so modest.you know, theyre not looking for government to solve all of their problems.', 'they just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if theyre about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the american dream.you know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about.and, you know, i have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government.', 'thats why i think were both running, and im very pleased that ive had this opportunity to run with senator clinton.russert: but the voters can only choose one, brian.russert: and i think you have a question.williams: well, we dont have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but i am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both.', 'and ill ask it of you fist, senator obama.what is the fundamental question you believe senator clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in ohio and in texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee?', 'and then we will ask the same question of senator clinton.obama: i have to say, brian, i think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee.', 'now, i think id be better.', 'otherwise, i wouldnt be running.', 'but theres no doubt that senator clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than john mccain, who i respect and i honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of george bush over the last seven years.on economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we cant afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we cant afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe.', 'we cant afford it in terms of strategy.so i dont think that senator clinton has to answer a question as to whether shes capable of being president or our standard bearer.i will say this, that the reason i think im better as the nominee is that i can bring this country together i think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region.', 'and that is whats going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both senator clinton and i care so much about.and i also think i have a track record, starting from the days i moved to chicago as a community organizer, when i was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a united states senator, i think i bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the american people can have confidence that their voice is being heard.those are things -- those are qualities that i bring to this race, and i hope that the people of ohio, texas, rhode island and vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the united states.williams: senator clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question senator obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness?clinton: well, brian, there isnt any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the white house.as i said last week, you know, its been an honor to campaign.', 'i still intend to do everything i can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making.you know, obviously i am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which i think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous...(applause)... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are.so i feel that either one of us will make history.the question that i have been posing is, who can actually change the country?', 'and i do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see.you know, when i wasnt successful about getting universal health care, i didnt give up.', 'i just got to work and helped to create the childrens health insurance program.', 'and, you know, today in ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance.', 'and yet this morning in lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident.', 'and she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, will you help us?thats what my public life has been about.', 'i want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have.', 'and i will do whatever i can here in ohio, in texas, rhode island, in the states to come making that case.', 'because i think we do need a fighter back in the white house.you know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president.', 'its time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can.', 'and they deserve somebody who gets up in that white house and goes to bat for them.and thats what i will do.williams: senator, thank you.']","['thepeoplesview janeosanders cnnpolitics jane doesnt care shes going to rome for 10 minutes', 'postpolitics socialist satire that bernster what a
